<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class ="tdc">SAM MORGAN'S BOY</p>


<p><big>Connie Morgan</big>, or as he is affectionately called
by the big, bearded men of the Yukon, Sam Morgan's
boy, now owns one of the crack dog teams
of Alaska. For Connie has set his heart upon
winning the great Alaska Sweepstakes&mdash;the grandest
and most exciting race in all the world, a race
that crowds both driver and dogs to the very last
measure of endurance, sagacity, and skill.</p>

<p>But that is another story. For Connie also owns
what is probably the most ludicrous and ill-assorted
three-dog team ever assembled; and he is never so
happy as when jogging slowly over the trail
behind old Boris, Mutt, and Slasher.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>No sourdough in his right senses would give fifty
dollars for the three, but Sam Morgan's boy would
gladly sacrifice his whole team of thousand-dollar
dogs to save any one of them. For it was the fine
courage and loyalty of this misfit team that enabled
him to beat out the Ten Bow stampede and file on
"One Below Discovery," next to Waseche Bill,
the big sourdough who is his partner&mdash;and who
loves him as Sam Morgan loved him before he
crossed the Big Divide.</p>

<p>Sam Morgan was among those who went to
Alaska in the first days of the great gold rush.
Like Peg's father in the play, Sam Morgan could
do anything but make money. So when the news
came of gold&mdash;bright, yellow gold lying loose on
the floors of creeks up among the snows of the
Arctic&mdash;Sam Morgan bid his wife and boy good-bye
at the door of the little cottage in a ten-carat
town of a middle State and fared forth to win
riches.</p>

<p>The man loved his wife and son with all the love
of his rugged nature, and for their sakes cheerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
endured the perils and hardships of the long trails
without a murmur. But in spite of his dogged
persistence and unflagging toil he never made a
strike. He was in the van of a dozen stampedes&mdash;stampedes
that made millionaires out of some men
and stark corpses out of others&mdash;but somehow
his claims never panned out.</p>

<p>Unlucky, men called him. And his name became
a byword for ill-luck throughout the length and
breadth of the Northland.</p>

<p>"She's a Sam Morgan," men would say, as they
turned in disappointment from an empty hole
driven deep into frozen gravel, and would wearily
hit the trail to sink other shafts in other gulches.</p>

<p>So Sam Morgan's luck became a proverb in the
North. But Sam Morgan, himself, men loved.
He was known among the meat-eaters as a man
whose word was as good as other men's bonds, and
his cheery smile made long trails less long. It was
told in the camps that on one occasion, during a
blizzard, he divided his last piece of bacon with a
half-starved Indian, and then, carrying the man on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his back, made eighteen miles through the storm
to the shelter of a prospector's cabin.</p>

<p>His word became law in the settling of disputes.
And to this day it is told on the trails how he
followed "British Kronk," who struck it rich on
the Black Horn, and abandoned his wife, leaving
her starving in the cabin where she would
surely have died had not Sam Morgan happened
along and found her; and of how, after eight
hundred miles of winter trail, he came upon him
in Candle, and of the great man-fight that took
place there on the hard-packed snow; of the tight
clamp of the square jaw, and the terrible gleam of
the grey eyes as, bare fisted, he made the huge
man beg for mercy; and of how he took the man
back, single-handed and without authority of law,
clear to Fort Yukon, and forced him to recognize
the woman and turn over to her a share of his gold.</p>

<p>It is not the bragging swashbucklers, the self-styled
"bad men," who win the respect of the
rough men upon the edges of the world. It is the
silent, smiling men who stand for justice and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
square deal&mdash;and who carry the courage of their
convictions in their two fists.</p>

<p>Of these things men tell in gruff tones, to the
accompaniment of hearty fist-bangs of approval.
With lowered voices they tell the story of "Sam
Morgan's Stumble," as the sharp elbow is called
where the Ragged Falls trail bends sharply around
a shoulder of naked rock, with a sheer drop of five
hundred feet to the boulder-strewn floor of the
creek bed. "Just Sam Morgan's luck," they
whisper. "The only place on the whole hundred
and fifty miles of the Ragged Falls trail where a
man could come to harm&mdash;right there he steps
on a piece of loose ice and stumbles head first
into the canyon. He sure played in tough luck,
Sam Morgan did. But he was a <i>man</i>!"</p>

<p>When the letters from the North ceased coming,
Sam Morgan's wife sickened and died.</p>

<p>"Jest nach'lly pined away a-waitin' fer word
from Sam," the neighbours said. And when fifteen-year-old
Connie returned to the empty cottage
from the bleak little cemetery on the outskirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the village, he sat far into the night and thought
things over.</p>

<p>In the morning he counted the few dollars he had
managed to save by doing odd jobs about the
village, and placing them carefully in his pocket,
together with a few trinkets that had belonged to
his mother, left the cottage and started in search of
Sam Morgan. He locked the door and laid the key
under the mat, just where he knew his father
would look for it should he return before he found
him.</p>

<p>Connie told nobody of his plans, said no good-byes,
but with a stout heart and a strange lump in
his throat, passed quietly out of the familiar village
and resolutely turned his face toward the great
white North.</p>

<p>Thus is was that a small boy stepped off the
last boat into Anvik that fall and mingled unnoticed
among the boisterous men who crowded
the shore. As the boat swung out into the current,
the men left the river and entered the wide,
low door of the trading post.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick Colton paused in his examination of
the pile of freight, and noticing for the first time
the forlorn little figure who stood watching the
departing boat, sauntered over and spoke:</p>

<p>"Hello, sonny, where you bound?"</p>

<p>The boy turned and gravely faced the smiling
man. "I've come to find my father," he answered.</p>

<p>"Where is your father?"</p>

<p>"He is here&mdash;somewhere."</p>

<p>"Here? In Anvik, you mean?"</p>

<p>"In Alaska."</p>

<p>The man uttered a low whistle. The smile was
gone from his face, and he noted the threadbare
cloth overcoat, and the bare legs showing through
the ragged holes in the boy's stockings.</p>

<p>"What is your father's name, boy?"</p>

<p>"Sam Morgan."</p>

<p>At the name the man started and an exclamation
escaped his lips.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" The boy's face was
eager with expectation, and the man found the
steadfast gaze of the blue eyes disconcerting.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just you wait here, son, for a minute, while
I run up to the store. Maybe some of the boys
know him." And he turned and hurried toward
the long, low building into which the men had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Boys!" he cried, bursting in on them, "there
is a kid out here. Came in on the boat. He is
hunting for his dad." The men ceased their
talk and looked at the speaker with interest.
"And, Heaven help us, it's Sam Morgan's boy!"</p>

<p>"Sam Morgan's boy! Sam Morgan's boy!"
In all parts of the room men repeated the words
and stared uneasily into each other's faces.</p>

<p>"He has got to be told," said Dick, with a
shake of the head. "You tell him, Pete. I
couldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Me neither. Here you, Waseche Bill, you
tell him."</p>

<p>"I cain't do it, boys. Honest I cain't. You
tell him." Thus each man urged his neighbour,
and in the midst of their half-spoken sentences
the door opened and the boy entered. An awk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>ward
hush fell upon them&mdash;the fifty rough, fur-clad
men whose bearded faces stared at him from
the gloom of the long, dark room&mdash;and the one
small boy who stared back with undisguised
interest. The silence became painful, and at
length someone spoke:</p>

<p>"So you're Sam Morgan's boy?" the man
asked, advancing and offering a great hairy hand.
The boy took the hand and bore the pain of the
mighty grip without flinching.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered. "Do you know
him&mdash;my father?"</p>

<p>"Sure I know him! Do I know Sam Morgan?
Well, I just guess I <i>do</i> know him! There ain't a
man 'tween here an' Dawson don't know Sam
Morgan!" Others crowded about and welcomed
the boy with rude kindness.</p>

<p>"Is my father here, in Anvik?" the boy asked of
the man called Pete.</p>

<p>"No, kid, he ain't here&mdash;in Anvik. Say,
Waseche, where is Sam Morgan at? Do you
know?" Thus Pete shifted the responsibility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
But Waseche Bill, a long, lank Kentuckian, was
equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Sam Mo'gan, he's up above, somewhe's,"
with a sweep of his arm in the direction
of the headwaters of the great river.</p>

<p>"That's right," others added, "Sam Morgan's
up above."</p>

<p>"When can I go to him?" asked the boy, and
again the men looked at each other helplessly.</p>

<p>"The's a bunch of us goin' up Hesitation way in
a day or two, an' yo' c'n go 'long of us. Sam's
cabin's at Hesitation. But yo' cain't go 'long in
that rig," he added, eyeing the threadbare overcoat
and ragged stockings.</p>

<p>"Oh! That's all right. I'll buy some warm
clothes. I've got money. Eight dollars!" exclaimed
the boy, proudly producing a worn leather
pocketbook in which were a few tightly wadded bills.</p>

<p>Eight dollars! In Alaska! And yet not a man
laughed. Waseche Bill placed his hand on the
boy's shoulder and smiled:</p>

<p>"Well, now, sonny, that's a right sma't lot o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
money, back in the States, but it don't stack up
very high in Alaska." He noticed the look of
disappointment with which the boy eyed his
hoard, and hastened to proceed: "But don't yo'
fret none. It's lucky yo' chanced 'long heah,
'cause I happen to be owin' Sam Mo'gan a hund'ed,
an' it's right handy fo' to pay it now." Hardly
had he ceased speaking when Dick Colton stepped
forward:</p>

<p>"I owe Sam fifty." "An' me!" "An' me,
too!" "An' me, I'd most forgot it!" The others
had taken their cue, and it seemed to the bewildered
boy as though these men owed his father all the
money in the world.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," he gasped. "Is
father rich? Has he made a strike, at last?"</p>

<p>"No, son," answered Dick, "your father is not
rich&mdash;in gold. He never made a strike. In
fact, he is counted the most unlucky man in the
North&mdash;in some ways." He turned his head. "But
just the same, boy, there's not a man in Alaska
but owes Sam Morgan more than he can pay."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me about him," cried the boy, his eyes
alight. "Did my father do some great thing?"
The silence was broken by old Scotty McCollough:</p>

<p>"Na', laddie, Sam Morgan never done no great
thing. He di' na' ha' to. He <i>was</i> great!" And by
the emphasis which the bluff old Scotchman placed
upon the word "was," of a sudden the boy knew!</p>

<p>"My father is dead!" he moaned, and buried
his face in his hands, while the men looked on
in silent sympathy. Only for a moment did the
boy remain so, then the little shoulders stiffened
under the thin overcoat, the hands dropped to
his side and clenched, and the square jaw set
firm&mdash;as Sam Morgan's had set, that day he faced
big "British Kronk" on the snow-packed street of
Candle. As the boy faced the men of the North,
he spoke, and his voice trembled.</p>

<p>"I will stay in Alaska," he said, "and dig for
the gold my father never found. I think he would
have liked it so." Suddenly the low-ceilinged
room rang with cheers and the boy was lifted
bodily onto the shoulders of the big men.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"You bet, he'd liked it!" yelled the man called
Pete.</p>

<p>"Yo'r Sam Mo'gan's boy all right&mdash;jest solid
grit clean through. It looks f'om heah like Sam's
luck has tu'ned at last!" cried Waseche Bill.</p>

<p>Two days later, when he hit the long trail
for Hesitation, in company with Waseche Bill,
Dick Colton, and Scotty McCollough, Sam Morgan's
boy was clad from <i>parka</i> hood to <i>mukluks</i>
in the most approved gear of the Northland.</p>

<p>He learned quickly the tricks of the trail, the
harnessing and handling of dogs, the choosing
of camps, and the hasty preparation of meals;
and in the evenings, as they sat close about the
camp fire, he never tired of listening as the men
told him of his father. His heart swelled with
pride, and in his breast grew a great longing
to follow in the footsteps of this man, and to
hold the place in the affections of the big, rough
men of the White Country that his father had
held.</p>

<p>All along the trail men grasped him by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hand. He made new friends at every camp.
And so it was that Sam Morgan's boy became the
pride of the Yukon.</p>

<p>At Hesitation he moved into his father's cabin,
and went to work for Scotty McCollough, who was
the storekeeper. Many a man went out of his
way to trade with Scotty that he might boast in
other camps that he knew Sam Morgan's boy.</p>

<p>One day Waseche Bill took him out on the
Ragged Falls trail where, at the foot of the precipice,
his father lay buried. The two stood long
at the side of the snow-covered mound, at the
head of which stood a little wooden cross with its
simple legend burned deep by the men who were
his friends:</p>

<p class="tdc"><big>
SAM MORGAN<br />
ALASKA<br /></big>
</p>

<p>The man laid a kindly hand on the boy's
shoulder:</p>

<p>"Notice, son, it don't say Hesitation, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Circle, nor Dawson&mdash;but just Alaska. It takes
a mighty big man to fill that there description
in this country," and the man brushed away a
tear of which he was not ashamed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE TEN BOW STAMPEDE</p>


<p><big>With</big> the passing of the winter Connie found
himself the proud possessor of a three-dog team.
Shortly after the trip to "Sam Morgan's Stumble,"
Waseche Bill disappeared into the north on
a solitary prospecting trip. Before he left he presented
Connie with old Boris, a Hudson Bay
dog famed in his day as the wisest trail dog on the
Yukon, and in spite of his years, a lead dog whose
sagacity was almost uncanny.</p>

<p>"He's been a great dog, son, but he's gettin'
too old fo' the long trails. I aimed to keep
him 'til he died, but I know yo'll use him right.
Just keep old Boris in the lead and he'll learn yo'
mo' trail knowledge than I could&mdash;or any otheh
man." Thus Waseche Bill took leave of the boy
and swung out into the trail with a younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
dog in the lead. Old Boris stood with drooping
tail beside his new master, and as the sled disappeared
over the bank and swept out onto the
ice of the river, as if in realization that for him the
trail days were over, he threw back his shaggy
head and with his muzzle pointing toward the
aurora-shot sky, sent a long, bell-like howl of
protest quavering into the chill air.</p>

<p>Later, a passing prospector presented Connie
with Mutt, a slow, heavily built dog, good-natured
and clumsy, who knew only how to throw
his great weight against the collar and pull until
his footing gave way.</p>

<p>The third dog of the team was Slasher, a
gaunt, untamed <i>malamute</i>, red-eyed and vicious&mdash;a
throwback to the wolf. His former owner,
tired of fighting him over the trails, was on the
point of shooting him when Connie interceded,
and offered to buy him.</p>

<p>"Why, son, he'd eat ye alive!" said the man;
"an' if harm was to come to Sam Morgan's boy
through fault of a man-eatin' wolf-dog which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
same he'd got off o' me, why, this here Alaska
land 'ud be too small to hold me. No, son, I
guess we'll jest put him out o' the way o' harmin'
folks." But the boy persisted, and to the unspeakable
amazement of the man, walked up and
loosened the heavy leather muzzle.</p>

<p>White fangs an inch long gleamed wickedly
as the boy patted his head, but the vicious, ripping
slash which the onlookers expected did not follow.
The crouching dog glared furtively, with back
curled lips&mdash;suspicious. Here was something he
did not understand&mdash;this man-brute of small
size who approached him bare-handed and without
a club. So he glared red-eyed, alert for some
new trick of torture. But nothing happened, and
presently from the pocket of his <i>parka</i> this
strange man-brute drew a piece of smoked fish
which the dog accepted from his bare fingers
with a lightning-like click of polished fangs, but
the fingers did not jerk away in fear even though
the fangs closed together a scant inch from their
ends.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>A piece of ham rind followed the fish and the
small man-brute reached down and flung the
hated muzzle far out into the snow, and with it
the collar and the thong lash.</p>

<p>The wolf-dog rose for the first time in his life
unfettered. He shook himself and surveyed
the astonished group of men. The stiff, coarse
hair along his spine stood erect and he uttered a
low throaty growl of defiance; then he turned and
stalked toward the boy, planting his feet deliberately
and stiffly after the manner of dogs whose
temper quivers on a hair-trigger. Guns were
loosened in the holsters of the men, but the boy
smiled and extended his hand toward the dog,
which advanced, the very personification of savage
hate.</p>

<p>The men gasped as the pointed muzzle touched
the small bared hand and a long, red tongue shot
out and licked the fingers. At the sound, the dog
placed himself before the boy and glared at them,
and then quietly followed Connie to the corral
at the rear of the log store.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's yours, son," exclaimed the prospector,
as the boy joined them. "No, I won't take no
pay for him. You saved his life, an' he b'longs
to you&mdash;only be careful. Don't never take your
eyes off him. I don't trust no <i>malamute</i>, let
alone that there Slasher dog."</p>

<p>With the lengthening of the days the Northland
began to feel the approach of spring. Snow melted
on the more exposed mountain slopes, and now
and then the trails softened, so that men camped
at midday.</p>

<p>Connie found time to take short excursions
with his team up the neighbouring gulches,
occasionally spending the night in the cabin of
some prospector.</p>

<p>He was beginning to regard himself as a "sure
enough sourdough" now, and could talk quite
wisely of cradles and rockers, of sluices and riffles,
and pay dirt and bed rock.</p>

<p>Then, one day when the store was full of miners
and prospectors awaiting the mail, Waseche Bill
burst into the room with the story of his big strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
on Ten Bow. Instantly pandemonium broke
loose. Men in a frenzy of excitement threw their
outfits onto sleds and swung the dogs onto the
ice trail of the river, struggling and fighting for
place.</p>

<p>McDougall, with his mail team of ten fast
<i>malamutes</i>, bet a thousand dollars he would beat
out Dutch Henry's crack Hudson Bays. Men
came down from the hills and joined the stampede,
and by evening a hundred dog teams were on the
trail.</p>

<p>During the excitement, Waseche Bill sought out
Connie and drew him to one side:</p>

<p>"Listen, son," whispered Waseche, speaking
hurriedly, and to the point, "git in on this, d'yo
heah? Quick now, git out yo' dogs an' hit the
trail. Old Boris'll take yo' theh. The's always
one mo' pull in a good dog, an' he'll unde'stand.
I've been wo'kin' Ten Bow fo' six months, an' he
knows the sho't-cut. Keep up yo' nerve, an'
follow that dog. He'll swing off up Little Rampa't,
an' the othe's will keep to the big riveh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&mdash;but
it's the long way 'round. It's only 'bout
eighty mile by the sho't-cut, an' a good two
hund'ed by the riveh. I come down the long way
so's to have a smooth trail fo' my new lead dog.
The other's a rough trail, over ridges an' acrost
gulches, up hill an' down, but yo' c'n make it!
Boris, he'll see yo' through. An' when yo'
strike Ten Bow&mdash;yo'll know it, 'cause it's the
only valley that shows red rock&mdash;swing no'th 'til
yo' come to a big split rock, an' theh yo'll find
my stakes.</p>

<p>"Now, listen! My claim'll be Discovery."
The man lowered his voice yet more: "An' yo'
stake out One Below Discovery&mdash;<i>below</i>, mind.
'Cause she's a sho' winneh, an' togetheh we'll
have the cream o' the gulch&mdash;me an' yo' will."</p>

<p>Many outfits passed Connie on the trail; the
men laughing and joking, good-naturedly urged
the boy onward. He only laughed in return, as
he encouraged his ill-matched team&mdash;Big Mutt
plunging against the collar, Slasher pulling wide
with the long jumps of the wolf-dog, and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Boris with lowered head, in the easy lope of the
born leader. Mile after mile they covered on the
smooth trail of the river, and it seemed to the
boy as if every outfit in Alaska had passed him in
the race. But he urged the dogs onward, for the
fever was in his blood&mdash;and like his father before
him, he was answering the call of gold.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a moment's hesitation, old
Boris swerved from the trail and headed for the
narrow cleft between two towering walls of rock,
which was the mouth of Little Rampart. On and
on they mushed, following the creek bed which
wound crookedly between its precipitous sides.</p>

<p>Again old Boris swerved. This time it was to
head up a steep, narrow pass leading into the
hills. Connie had his hands full at the gee-pole,
for it was dark now&mdash;not the black darkness of the
States, but the sparkling, star-lit dark of the
aurora land.</p>

<p>He camped at midnight on a flat plateau near
the top of a high divide. Morning found him
again on the trail. He begrudged every minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of inaction, for well he knew the fame of McDougall's
mail dogs, and Dutch Henry's Hudson
Bays. It turned warmer. The snow slumped
under foot, and he lost two hours at midday,
waiting for the stiffening chill of the lengthening
shadows.</p>

<p>On the third day it snowed. Not the fierce,
cutting snow of the fall and winter, but large,
feathery flakes, that lay soft and deep on the crust
and piled up in front of the sled. That night
he camped early, for both boy and dogs were
weary with the trail-strain.</p>

<p>During the night the snow stopped falling and
the wind rose, driving it into huge drifts. Progress
was slow now and every foot of the trail
was hard-earned. Old Boris picked his way among
boulders and drifts with the wisdom of long
practice. Slasher settled down to a steady pull,
and Big Mutt threw himself into the collar and
fairly lifted the sled through the loose snow. Toward
noon they slanted into a wide valley, and
the tired eyes of the boy brightened as they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the bold outcropping of red rock. Then immediately
they grew serious, and he urged the dogs to
greater effort, for, far down the valley, dotting
the white expanse of snow, were many moving
black specks.</p>

<p>Old Boris turned toward the north, and the
boy saw the huge split rock a mile away. He
was travelling ahead of the dogs now, throwing
his weight onto the <i>babiche</i> rope, his wide snowshoes
breaking the trail. In spite of his efforts
the pace was dishearteningly slow. Every few
minutes he glanced back, and each time the
black specks appeared larger and more distinct.
He could make out men and sleds, and he knew
by the long string of dogs that the first outfit was
McDougall's.</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi! Mush you! Mush you!" faintly
the sound was borne to his ears, and he knew that
McDougall was gaining fast&mdash;he had already
broken into Connie's own freshly made trail. The
dogs heard it, too, and with cocked ears plunged
blindly ahead.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The split rock loomed tantalizingly near,
and the boy thanked his stars that he had prepared
his stakes beforehand. He loosened them
from the back of the sled and, ax in hand, ploughed
ahead through the loose snow. His racket
struck something hard and he pitched forward&mdash;it
was one of Waseche Bill's stakes.</p>

<p>Feverishly he scrambled to his feet and drove
in his own stakes, following Waseche's directions.
With a final blow of his ax, he turned to face
McDougall, who stared at him wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"You dang little scamp!" he roared. "You
dang little sourdough!" And as he staked out
number Two Below Discovery, the hillsides
echoed back his laughter.</p>

<p>Other men came. Soon the valley of the
Ten Bow was staked with claims running into
the forties, both above and below Discovery.
But the great prize of all was One Below, and
it stood marked by the stakes of Sam Morgan's
boy.</p>

<p>That night the valley of the Ten Bow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dotted with a hundred camp fires, and the air
rang with snatches of rude song and loud laughter.</p>

<p>Men passed from fire to fire and Connie Morgan's
name was on every tongue.</p>

<p>"The little scamp!" men laughed; "cut straight
through the hills with them old discarded dogs,
an' beat us to it!" "Now, what d'ye know
'bout <i>that</i>?" "If Sam Morgan c'd lived to seen it
he'd be'n the tickledest man in the world!"
"Poor old Sam&mdash;looks like his luck's turned at
last!"</p>

<p>From the surrounding gloom a man stepped
into the light of a large camp-fire near which
Connie Morgan was seated talking with a group
of prospectors. He was a little, rat-like man,
with a pinched, weasel face and little black
eyes that shone beadlike from between lashless
lids.</p>

<p>"This Number One claim, boys, it ain't legal.
It's staked by a boy. I'm a lawyer, an' I know.
He's a minor, an' he can't hold no claim!" He
spoke hurriedly, and eyed the men for signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
approval; then he advanced toward Connie,
shaking a long, bony finger.</p>

<p>"You ain't twenty-one," he squeaked, "an' I
command you to vacate this claim in the name of
the law!" From the boy's side came a low growl.
There was a flash of grey in the firelight, and the
wolf-dog was at the man's throat, bearing him
backward into the snow.</p>

<p>The boy was on his feet in an instant, pulling
at the dog and beating him off. Luckily for the
man his throat was protected by the heavy <i>parka</i>
hood, and he sustained no real damage. He arose
whimpering with fright.</p>

<p>The other men were on their feet now, and one
of them knocked the revolver from the hand of the
cowering man as he aimed it at the growling
Slasher.</p>

<p>Big McDougall stepped forward, and, grasping
the man by the shoulder, spun him around with a
jerk.</p>

<p>"Look a here, you reptile! Kin ye guess
what that dog 'ud of done to ye, an' it hadn't be'n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fer the kid? Well, fer my part he c'd gone ahead
an' done it as it was. But, seein' he didn't, just
ye listen to me! What he would done won't be a
patchin' to what I <i>will</i> do to ye, if ever ye open
yer head about that there claim ag'in. An'
that ain't all. There's a hundred men in this
gulch&mdash;good men&mdash;sourdoughs, ev'ry one&mdash;an'
the kid beat us all fair an' square. An', law or
no law, we're right here to see that Sam Morgan's
boy <i>does</i> hold down that claim! <i>An' don't ye
fergit it!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE NEW CAMP</p>


<p>The fame of Ten Bow travelled to far reaches,
and because in the gold country men are fascinated
by prosperity, even though it is the prosperity
of others, the shortening days brought many
new faces into the mining camp of Ten Bow.
Notwithstanding the fact that every square foot of
the valley was staked, gaunt men, whose hollow
eyes and depleted outfits spoke failure, mushed in
from the hills, knowing that here cordwood must
be chopped, windlasses cranked, and fires kept
going, and preferring the certainty of high wages
at day labour to the uncertainty of a new strike
in unscarred valleys.</p>

<p>It was six months since Waseche Bill had burst
into Scotty McCollough's store at Hesitation
with the news of his great strike in the red rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
valley to the southward&mdash;news that spread like
wildfire through the camp and sent two hundred
men over the trail in a frenzied rush for gold.</p>

<p>It was a race long to be remembered in the
Northland&mdash;the Ten Bow stampede. It is told
to this day on the trails, by bearded <i>tillicums</i>
amid roars of bull-throated laughter and deep
man-growls of approval, how the race was won
by a boy&mdash;a slight, wiry, fifteen-year-old <i>chechako</i>
who, scorning the broad river trail with its hundred
rushing dog teams, struck straight through the
hill with a misfit three-dog outfit, and staked
"One Below Discovery" under the very noses
of Big McDougall and his mail team of gaunt
<i>malamutes</i>, and Dutch Henry with his Hudson
Bays.</p>

<p>From the glacier-studded seaboard to the great
white death barriers beyond the Yukon, wherever
men forgathered, the fame of Connie Morgan, and
old Boris, Mutt, and Slasher, passed from bearded
lip to bearded lip, and the rough hearts of big,
trail-toughened prospectors swelled with pride at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the mention of his name. Only, in the big white
country, he is never called Connie Morgan, but
Sam Morgan's boy; for Sam Morgan was Alaska's&mdash;big,
quiet Sam Morgan, who never made a
"strike," but stood for a square deal and the
right of things as they are. And, as they loved
Sam Morgan, these men loved Sam Morgan's
boy. For it had been told in the hills how Dick
Colton found him, ill-clad and ragged, forlornly
watching the wheezy little Yukon steamer swing
out into the stream at Anvik, whence he had come
in search of his father. And how, when he
learned that Sam Morgan had crossed the Big
Divide, he bravely clenched his little fists, choked
back the hot tears, and told the big men of the
North, as he faced them there, that he would stay
in Alaska and dig for the gold his father never
found.</p>

<p>The Ten Bow stampede depopulated Hesitation,
and the new camp of Ten Bow sprang up
in a day, two hundred miles to the southward.
A camp of tents and <i>igloos</i> it was, for in the mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
scramble for gold men do not stop to build substantial
cabins, but improvise makeshift shelters
from the bitter cold of the long nights, out of
whatever material is at hand. For the Ten Bow
strike came late in the season and, knowing that
soon the water from the melting snows would
drive them from their claims, men worked feverishly
in the black-mouthed shafts that dotted the
valley, and at night chopped cordwood and kept
the fires blazing that thawed out the gravel
for the morrow's digging. When the break-up
came men abandoned the shafts and, with rude
cradles and sluices, and deep gold pans, set to
work on the frozen gravel of the dumps.</p>

<p>And then it was men realized the richness
of the Ten Bow strike. Not since the days of
Sand Creek and the Klondike had gravel yielded
such store of the precious metal. As they cleaned
up the riffles they laughed and talked wildly of
wealth undreamed; for the small dumps, representing
a scant sixty days' digging, panned out
more gold than any man in Ten Bow had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
taken out in a year&mdash;more than most men had
taken out in many years of disheartening, bone-racking
toil.</p>

<p>During the long days of the short summer,
while the cold waters of Ten Bow rushed northward
toward the Yukon, log cabins replaced the tents
and <i>igloos</i>, and by the end of August Ten Bow
assumed an air of stability which its prosperity
warranted. Scotty McCollough freighted his
goods from Hesitation and soon presided over a
brand new log store, which varied in no whit nor
particular from the other log stores of other camps.</p>

<p>Those were wonderful days for Connie Morgan.
Days during which the vague, half-formed impressions
of youth were recast in a rough mould by
association with the bearded men who treated
him as an equal. He learned their likes and dislikes,
their joys and sorrows, their shortcomings
and virtues, and in the learning, he came instinctively
to look under the surface and gauge men
by their true worth&mdash;which is so rarely the great
world's measure of men. And, under the uncon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>scious
tutelage of these men, was laid the foundation
for the uncompromising sense of right and
justice which was to become the underlying
principle of the hand-hammered character of the
man who would one day help shape the destiny
of Alaska, and safeguard her people from the outreaching
greed of monopoly.</p>

<p>Daily the boy worked shoulder to shoulder with
his partner, Waseche Bill, the man who had presented
him with old Boris, and whispered of the
short-cut through the hills which had enabled
him to beat out the Ten Bow stampede.</p>

<p>Now, the building of cabins is not easy work.
Getting out logs, notching their ends, and rolling
them into place, one above another, is a man's
job. And many were the pretexts and fictions
by which the men of Ten Bow contrived to relieve
Connie of the heavier work in the building of his
home.</p>

<p>"Sonny," said Big McDougall one day,
loafing casually over from the adjoining claim
where his own cabin was nearing completion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
"swar to gudeness, my back's like to bust wi'
stoopin' over yon chinkin'. C'u'dn't ye jist slip
over to my place an' spell the auld mon off a
bit. I'm mos' petered out." So Connie obligingly
departed and, as he rammed in the moss and
daubed it with mud, peered through a crack and
smiled knowingly as he watched the "petered out"
man heaving and straining by the side of Waseche
Bill in the setting of a log. And the next day it
was Dutch Henry who removed the short pipe
from his mouth and called from his doorway:</p>

<p>"Hey, kid! Them dawgs o' mine is gittin'
plumb scan'lous fat an' lazy. Seems like ef they
don't git a workin' out they'll spile on me complete.
Looks like I never fin' no time to fool with 'em.
Now, ef you c'd make out to take 'em down the
trail today, I'd sure take it mighty kind of ye."
And when Connie returned to the camp it was to
find Dutch Henry helping Waseche Bill in the
rope-rolling of a roof log. And so it went each
day until the cabin stood complete under its dirt
roof. Some one or another of the big-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
miners, with a sly wink at Waseche Bill, invented
a light job which would take the boy from the
claim and then took his place, grinning happily.</p>

<p>But Connie Morgan understood, and because
he loved these men, kept his own counsel, and the
big men never knew that the small, serious-eyed
boy saw through their deception.</p>

<p>At last the cabin was finished and the boy took
a keen delight in helping his big partner in the
building of the furniture. Two bunks, a table,
three or four chairs, and a wash bench&mdash;rude but
serviceable&mdash;were fashioned from light saplings
and packing case boards, brought up from Scotty's
store. In the new camps lumber is scarce, and
the canny Scotchman realized a tidy sum from the
sale of his empty boxes.</p>

<p>In the shortening days men returned to the
diggings and sloshed about in the wet gravel,
cleaning up as they went; for before long, the
freezing of the water would compel them to throw
the gravel onto dumps to be worked out the
following spring.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The partners hired a man to help with the
heavier work and Connie busied himself with the
hundred and one odd jobs about the claims and
cabin. He became a wonderful cook, and Waseche
Bill, returning from the diggings, always found a
hot meal of well-prepared food awaiting his
ravenous appetite, while the men of other cabins
returned tired and wet to growl and grumble over
the cooking of their grub.</p>

<p>Late in September the creek froze. Blizzard
after whirling blizzard followed upon the heels
of a heavy snowfall, and the Northland lay white
and cold in the grip of the long winter. Ten
Bow was a humming hive of activity. Windlasses
creaked in the thin, frosty air, to the half-muffled
cries of "haul away" which floated
upward from the depths of the shafts, and the hillsides
rang with the stroke of axes and the long
crash of falling trees. By night the red flare of a
hundred fires lighted the snow for miles and
seemed reflected in the aurora-shot sky; and with
each added bucketful, the dumps grew larger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
showed black and ugly against the white snow of
the valley.</p>

<p>To conform to the mining laws the partners
sank a shaft on each claim, working them alternately,
and the experienced eye of Waseche Bill
told him that the gravel he daily shovelled into
the bucket was fabulously rich in gold.</p>

<p>And then, one day, at a depth of ten feet,
Waseche Bill's pick struck against something
hard. He struck again and the steel rang loudly
in the cistern-like shaft. With his shovel he
scraped away the thin covering of loose gravel
which was deepest where his claim joined Connie's.</p>

<p>That evening the boy wondered at the silence
of his big partner, who devoured his beans and
bacon and sourdough bread, and washed them
down with great draughts of black coffee. But
he spoke no word, and after supper helped Connie
with the dishes and then, filling his pipe, tilted
his chair against the log wall and smoked, apparently
engrossed in deep thought. At the table,
Connie, poring over the contents of a year-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
illustrated magazine, from time to time cast furtive
glances toward the man and wondered at
his strange silence. After a while the boy laid
the magazine aside, drew the bootjack from beneath
the bunk, pulled off his small boots, and
with a sleepy "good-night, pardner," rolled snugly
into his blankets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class ="tdc">PARTNERS</p>


<p>For a long time Waseche Bill sat tilted back
against the wall. His pipe went out unheeded
and remained black and cold, gripped between
his clenched teeth. At length he arose and, noiselessly
crossing the room, stood looking down at
the tousled yellow curls that shone dully in the
lamp-light at the end of the roll of blankets. Making
sure that the boy slept, he began silently to
assemble his trail pack. Tent, blankets, grub,
and rifle he bound firmly onto the strong dog-sled,
and returning to the room, slid back a loose
board from its place in the floor. From the black
hole beneath he withdrew a heavy buckskin
pouch and, pouring the contents onto a folded
paper, proceeded to divide equally the pile of
small glittering particles, and the flattened black
nuggets of water-worn gold. One portion he
stuffed into a heavy canvas money belt which he
strapped about him, the other he placed in the
pouch and returned to its hiding place under the
floor. He fumbled in his pocket for the stub of a
lead pencil and, with a sheet of brown paper
before him, sat down at the table and began
laboriously to write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Making sure that the boy slept, he began silently to assemble
his trail pack.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Waseche Bill had never written a letter, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had he ever received one. There was no one to
write to, for, during an epidemic of smallpox
in a dirty, twenty-two calibre town of a river
State, he had seen his mother and father placed
in long, black, pine boxes, by men who worked
swiftly and silently, and wore strange-looking
white masks with sponges at the mouth, and
terrible straight, black robes which smelled
strongly, like the open door of a drug store, and
he had seen the boxes carried out at night and
placed on a flat dray which drove swiftly away
in the direction of the treeless square of sand
waste, within whose white-fenced enclosure a few
cheap marble slabs gleamed whitely among
many wooden ones. All this he watched from the
window, tearful, terrorized, alone, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
same window watched the dray driven hurriedly
back through the awful silence of the deserted
street and stop before other houses where other
black boxes were carried out by the strange,
silent men dressed in their terrible motley.</p>

<p>The next day other men came and took him
away to the "home." That is, the men called it a
"home," but it was not at all like the home he
had left where there was always plenty to eat, and
where mother and father, no matter how tired
and worried they were, always found time to
smile or romp, and in the long evenings, to tell
stories. But in this new home were a matron and
a superintendent, instead of mother and father,
and, except on visiting days, there was rarely
enough to eat, and many rules to be obeyed, and
irksome work to be done that tired small bodies.
And instead of smiles and romps and stories there
were frowns and whippings and quick, terrifying
shakings and scoldings over hard lessons. He
remembered how one day he stole out through
an unlocked gate and hid until dark in a weed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
patch, and then trudged miles and miles through
the long night and in the morning found himself
in the bewildering outskirts of a great city&mdash;he
was not Waseche Bill then, but just Willie Antrum,
a small boy, who at the age of nine faced the great
world alone.</p>

<p>The solving of the problem of existence had
left scant time for book learning, and the man
regretted the fact now when he was called upon
for the first time to express himself in writing.
He had never examined a letter; his brief excursions
into the field of literature having been confined
to the recording of claim papers, and the
painful spelling out of various notices, handbills,
and placards, which were posted from time to
time in conspicuous places about trading posts
or docks. He puzzled long over how to begin,
and at each word paused to tug at his long
moustache, and glower helplessly and gnaw the
end of his stubby pencil. At last he finished,
and weighting the paper with his own new,
six-bladed jackknife crossed again to the bunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and stood for a long time looking down at the
sleeping boy.</p>

<p>"I sho' do hate to go 'way an' leave yo' li'l'
pa'd," he murmured. "Feels like pullin' teeth
in yere." The big fingers pressed the front of
his blue flannel shirt. "But it cain't neveh be
tole how Waseche Bill done helt his pa'dneh
to a bad ba'gain afteh his own claim run
out&mdash;an' him only a kid. Ef yo' was a man
'twould be dif'ent, but yo' ain't, an' when
you' grow'd up yo' might think I tuk advantage
of yo'."</p>

<p>"Sam Mo'gan unlucky!" he exclaimed, under
his breath, "Why ef yo' was my reg'lar own
boy, pa'd, I'd be the luckiest man in Alaska&mdash;if
I neveh struck coleh. Unlucky, sho'!" And
with a suspicious winking of the eyes, and a
strange lump in his throat, Waseche Bill blew
out the lamp, closed the door softly behind him,
harnessed his dogs, and swung out onto the moonlit
trail which gleamed white and cold between
low-lying ridges of stunted spruce.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie Morgan awoke next morning with a
feeling that all was not well. It was dark in the
cabin, but his ears could detect no sound of heavy
breathing from the direction of his partner's
bunk. Hastily he slipped from under his blankets
and lighted the tin reflector lamp. As the yellow
light flooded the room the boy's heart almost
stopped beating and there was a strange sinking
feeling at the pit of his stomach, like that day at
Anvik when the little Yukon steamer churned
noisily away from the log pier. For Waseche
Bill's bunk was empty and his blankets were
gone, and so was the tent that had lain in
a compact bale in the corner, and Waseche
Bill's rifle was missing from its pegs over the
window.</p>

<p>Suddenly his glance was arrested by the scrap
of paper upon the table, where the rays of light
glinted on the backs of the polished blades. He
snatched up the paper and holding it close to the
light, spelled out, with difficulty, the scrawling
lines:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>NOTISS.</p>

<p>The boy finished reading and, dropping his
head in his folded arms, sobbed as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>Big McDougall was aroused in the early grey
of the cold Alaska dawn by an insistent pounding
upon his door.</p>

<p>"Come in, can't ye! D'ye want to break doon
the hoose?" And as Connie Morgan burst into
the room, he sat upon the edge of his bunk and
grinned sleepily.</p>

<p>"What's ailin' ye lad, ye look flustered?"</p>

<p>"Waseche's gone!" cried the boy, in a choking
voice, as he thrust the paper into the great hairy
hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone?" questioned the man, and began slowly
to decipher the scrawl. At length he glanced
at the boy who stood impatiently by.</p>

<p>"Weel?" the Scotchman asked.</p>

<p>"I want your dogs!"</p>

<p>The man scratched his head.</p>

<p>"What'll ye be up to wi' the dogs?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to find Waseche, of course. He's
my pardner, and I'm going to stay by him!"
McDougall slowly drew on his boots, and when
he looked up his bearded face was expressionless.</p>

<p>"D'ye onderstan' that Waseche's claim's no
gude? It sloped off shallow rock onto yourn, an'
it's worked out a'ready. Waseche, he's gone, an'
ye're full owner o' the best claim on the Ten Bow.
You ain't got no pardner to divide up wi'&mdash;it's
all yourn."</p>

<p>The boy regarded him with blazing eyes:</p>

<p>"What do you mean, I have no pardner?
Waseche <i>is</i> my pardner, and you bet he'll find
that out when I catch him! I'll stick by him
no matter what he says, and if he won't come back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I won't either! Of course I've got the best claim
on Ten Bow, but Waseche put me onto it, and
gave me old Boris, and&mdash;" his voice broke and
the words came choking between dry sobs&mdash;"and
that day in Anvik he said he owed my father a
hundred dollars, and the others all chipped in&mdash;I
thought it was true then&mdash;but I know now&mdash;and
I shut up about it because they thought I
never knew!</p>

<p>"I don't want the claim, I want Waseche!
And I'll stick by him if I have to abandon the
claim. Pardners are pardners! and when I
catch that old <i>tillicum</i> I'll&mdash;I'll bring him back
if I have to <i>beat him up</i>! My dad licked British
Kronk at Candle&mdash;and British was bigger! He's
<i>got</i> to come back!" The small fists were doubled
and the small voice rang shrill and high with
righteous indignation. Suddenly Big McDougall's
hand shot out and gripped the little fist, which
he wrung in a mighty grip.</p>

<p>"Ah, laddie, fer all yer wee size, ye're a <i>mon</i>!
Run ye the noo, an' pack the sled whilst I harness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the dogs. Wi' that ten-team ye'll come up wi'
Waseche anent Ragged Falls Post." Twenty
minutes later the boy appeared with his own
dogs unleashed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 658px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;McDougall&#39;s prize <i>malamutes</i> shot out on the trail.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Mush! Boris, find Waseche! Mush!" And
the old dog, in perfect understanding, uttered
a low whine of eagerness, and headed northward
at a run. The next instant the boy threw himself
belly-wise onto the sled and McDougall's
prize <i>malamutes</i> shot out on the trail of the old
lead dog, with big Mutt and the red-eyed Slasher
running free in their wake.</p>

<p>Standing in his doorway, the Scotchman
watched them dwindle in the distance, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
distinctly to his ears, through the still, keen air,
was borne the sharp creak of runners and the thin
shouts of the boy as he urged the dogs over the
hard-packed trail:</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi! Mush-u! Mush-u! Chook-e-e-e!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class ="tdc">ON THE TRAIL OF WASECHE</p>


<p>Waseche Bill loved the North. The awful
grandeur of the naked peaks towering above
wooded heights, the wide sweep of snow valleys,
the chill of the thin, keen air, and the mystic
play of the aurora never failed to cast their magic
spell over the heart of the man as he answered
the call of the long white trails. And, until
Connie Morgan came into his life, he had loved
<i>only</i> the North.</p>

<p>Accustomed to disappointment&mdash;that bitter heritage
of the men who seek gold&mdash;he took the trail
from Ten Bow as he had many times taken other
trails, and from the moment the dogs strung out
at the crack of his long-lashed whip, his mind was
busy with plans for the future.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'll pass up Ragged Falls. The's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
nothin' theh&mdash;Coal Creek's staked, an' Dog
Creek, an' Tanatat's done wo'ked out. Reckon
I'll jest drift up Eagle way an git holt of some mo'
dogs an' a new outfit, an' me'be take on a pa'dner
an' make a try fo' the Lillimuit." Mile after
mile he covered, talking aloud to himself, as
is the way of the men of the silent places, while
the smooth-worn runners of the sled slipped over
the well-packed trail.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was brilliant with the shifting,
many-hued lights of the aurora borealis, which
threw a weird, flickering glow over the drear
landscape. It was the kind of a night Waseche
loved, when the cold, hard world lay veiled
in the half-light of mystery. But his mind
was not upon the wild beauty of his surroundings.
His heart was heavy, and a strange
sense of loneliness lay like a load upon his breast.
For, not until he found himself alone upon
the trail, did he realize how completely his
little partner had taken possession of his rough,
love-starved heart. Yet, not for an instant did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he regret his course in the abandonment of the
claim.</p>

<p>"It's all in a lifetime," he murmured, "an' I
didn't do so bad, at that. I 'speck theh's clost
to ten thousan' in my poke right now&mdash;but the
boy's claim! Gee Whiz! Fust an' last it ort to
clean up a million! But, 'taint leavin' all that
gold in the gravel that's botherin' me. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;I
reckon it's jest the boy <i>hisself</i>. Li'l ol'
sourdough!</p>

<p>"Hayr, yo' One Ear, yo'! Quit yo' foolin'!
I'm talkie' like a woman. Mush on!"</p>

<p>At daybreak, when he struck the wide trail of
the big river, Waseche Bill halted for breakfast,
fed and rested his dogs, and swung upstream on
the long trail for Eagle.</p>

<div class="p4" />

<p>McDougall's ten <i>malamutes</i> were the pride of
McDougall and the envy of the Yukon. As they
disappeared in the distance bearing Connie
Morgan on the trail of his deserting "pardner,"
the big Scotchman turned and entered his cabin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a braw lad," he rumbled, as he busied
himself about the stove. "To Waseche's mind
the lad's but a wee lad; an' the mon done what few
men w'd done when ut come to the test. But,
fer a' his sma' size the lad's uncanny knowin',
an' the heart o' um's the heart o' a <i>tillicum</i>.</p>

<p>"He'll fetch Waseche back, fer he'll tak' na
odds&mdash;an' a gude job ut'll be&mdash;fer, betwixt me
an' mesel', the ain needs the ither as much as the
ither needs the ain. 'Tis the talk o' the camp
that ne'er a nicht sin' Ten Bow started has Waseche
darkened the door o' Dog Head Jake's saloon,
an' they aint a sourdough along the Yukon but
what kens when things was different wi' Waseche
Bill."</p>

<p>Out on the trail, Connie urged the dogs forward.
Like Waseche Bill, he, too, had learned to love
the great White Country, but this day he had eyes
only for the long sweep of the trail and the flying
feet of the <i>malamutes</i>.</p>

<p>"I must catch him! I've <i>got</i> to catch him!" he
kept repeating to himself, as the flying sled shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
along hillsides and through long stretches of
stunted timber. "He'll make Ragged Falls Post
tonight, and I'll make it before morning."</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen before the long team swept
out onto the Yukon. Overhead the stars winked
coldly upon the broad surface of the frozen river
whose snow reefs and drifts, between which
wound the trail, lay like the marble waves of a
sculptured ocean.</p>

<p>Old Boris, running free in the lead, paused at the
junction of the trails, sniffed at the place where
Waseche had halted early in the morning, and
loped unhesitatingly up the river. The old lead
dog was several hundred yards in advance of the
team, and cut off from sight by the high-piled
drifts; so that when Connie reached the spot he
swung the <i>malamutes</i> downstream in the direction
of Ragged Falls Post, never for an instant suspecting
that his partner had taken the opposite trail.</p>

<p>For several minutes old Boris ran on with his
nose to the snow, then, missing the sound of the
scratching feet and the dry husk of the runners, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
paused and listened with ears cocked and eyes in
close scrutiny of the back trail. Surely, those were
the sounds of the dog team&mdash;but why were they
growing fainter in the distance? The old dog
whimpered uneasily, and then, throwing back his
head, gave voice to a long, bell-like cry which,
floating out on the tingling air like the blast
of a bugle, was borne to the ears of the boy on the
flying dog sled, already a half-mile to the westward.
At his sharp command, the well trained
<i>malamutes</i> nearly piled up with the suddenness
of their stop. The boy listened breathlessly and
again it sounded&mdash;the long-drawn howl he knew so
well. "Why has Boris left the trail," wondered
the boy. "Had Waseche met with an accident
and camped? Were the feet of his dogs sore?
Was he hurt?" Connie glanced at his own two
dogs, Mutt and Slasher, who, unharnessed, had followed
in his wake. They, too, heard the call of
their leader and had crouched in the snow, gazing
backward. Quickly he swung the sled dogs and
dashed back at a gallop. Passing the point where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Ten Bow trail slanted into the hills, he urged
the dogs to greater effort. If something had happened
and Waseche had camped, the quicker he
found him the better. But, if Waseche had not
camped, and old Boris was fooling him, it would
mean nearly an hour lost in useless doubling. With
anxious eyes he scanned the trail ahead, seeking to
penetrate the gloom of the Arctic night. At length,
as the sled shot from between two high-piled drifts,
he made out a dark blotch in the distance, which
quickly resolved itself into the figure of the old
lead dog sitting upon his haunches with ears
alert for the approaching sled. Connie whistled,
a loud, peculiar whistle, and the old dog bounded
forward with short, quick yelps of delight.</p>

<p>"Where is Waseche, Boris?" The boy had
leaped from the sled and was mauling the rough
coat playfully. "Find Waseche! Boris! Go
find him!" With a sharp, joyful bark, the old
dog leaped out upon the trail and the wolf-dogs
followed. A mile slipped past&mdash;two miles&mdash;and
no sign of Waseche! The boy called a halt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"Boris is fooling me," he muttered, with disappointment.
"He couldn't have come this far
and gotten back to the place I found him."</p>

<p>Connie had once accompanied Waseche Bill
to Ragged Falls Post and when he took the trail
it was with the idea that Waseche had headed
for that point. Unconsciously, Scotty McDougall
had strengthened the conviction when he told
the boy he should overtake his partner at Ragged
Falls. So now it never occurred to him that the
man had taken the trail for Eagle, which lay four
days to the south-east.</p>

<p>Disappointed in the behaviour of the old dog,
upon whose sagacity he had relied, and bitterly
begrudging the lost time, he whistled Boris in
and tried to start him down the river. But the
old dog refused to lead and continued to make
short, whimpering dashes in the opposite direction.
At last, the boy gave up in despair and
headed the team for Ragged Falls, and Boris,
with whimpered protests and drooping tail,
followed beside Mutt and Slasher.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>All night McDougall's <i>malamutes</i> mushed
steadily over the trail, and in the grey of the
morning, as they swept around a wide bend
of the great river, the long, low, snow-covered
roof of Ragged Falls Post, with its bare flagpole,
appeared crowning a flat-topped bluff on the right
bank.</p>

<p>Connie's heart bounded with relief at the
sight. For twenty hours he had urged the dogs
over the trail with only two short intervals of
rest, and now he had reached his goal&mdash;and
Waseche!</p>

<p>"Wonder what he'll say?" smiled the tired boy.
"I bet he'll be surprised to see me&mdash;and glad, too&mdash;only
he'll pretend not to be. Doggone old
<i>tillicum</i>! He's the best pardner a man ever had!"</p>

<p>Eagerly the boy swung the dogs at the steep
slope that led to the top of the bluff. A thin
plume of smoke was rising above the roof; there
was the sound of an opening door, and a man
in shirt sleeves eyed the approaching outfit
sleepily. Connie recognized him as Black Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Demaree, the storekeeper. And then the boy's
heart almost stopped beating, for the gate of the
log stockade that served as a dog corral stood open,
and upon the packed snow before the door was no
sled.</p>

<p>"Hello, sonny!" called the man from the doorway.
"Well, dog my cats! If it ain't Sam
Morgan's boy! Them's Scotty McDougall's team,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Where's Waseche Bill?" asked the boy, ignoring
the man's greeting.</p>

<p>"Waseche Bill! Why, I ain't saw Waseche
sense you an' him was down las' summer." The
small shoulders drooped wearily, and the small
head turned away, as, choking back the tears of
disappointment, the boy stared out over the
river. The man looked for a moment at the
dejected little figure and, stepping to his side, laid
a rough, kindly hand on the boy's arm.</p>

<p>"Come, sonny; fust off, we'll git the dawgs unharnessed
an' fed, an' then, when we git breakfas' et,
we c'n make medicine." The boy shook his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't stop," he said; "I must find Waseche."</p>

<p>"Now, look a here, don't you worry none 'bout
Waseche. That there ol' sourdough'll take care of
hisself. Why, he c'n trail through a country where
a wolf w'd starve to death!</p>

<p>"Ye've got to eat, son. An' yer dawgs has
got to eat an' rest. I see ye're in a hurry, an' I
won't detain ye needless. Mind ye, they worn't
no better man than Sam Morgan, yer daddy,
an' he worn't above takin' advice off a friend."
Without a word the boy fell to and helped the
man, who was already unharnessing the dogs.</p>

<p>"Now, son, 'fore ye turn in fer a few winks,"
said Black Jack Demaree, as he gulped down the
last of his coffee and filled his pipe. "Jes' loosten
up an' tell me how come you an' Waseche ain't
up on Ten Bow workin' yer claim?"</p>

<p>The man listened attentively as the boy told
how his partner's claim had sloped off into his own
and "petered out." And of how Waseche Bill had
taken the trail in the night, so the boy would have
an undivided interest in the good claim. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
also, of how, when he woke up and found his
partner gone, he had borrowed McDougall's
dogs and followed. And, lastly, of the way old
Boris acted at the fork of the trails. When the
boy finished, the man sat for several minutes
puffing slowly at his short, black pipe, and watching
the blue smoke curl upward. Presently he
cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"In the first place, sonny, ye'd ort to know'd
better'n to go contrary to the ol' dawg. In this
here country it's as needful to know dawgs as it is
to know men. That there's a lesson ye won't
soon fergit&mdash;never set up yer own guess agin' a
good dawgs nose. Course, ye've got to know
yer dawg. Take a rankus pup that ain't got
no sense yet, an' he's li'ble to contankerate off on
the wrong trail&mdash;but no one wouldn't pay no
heed to him, no more'n they would to some raw
shorthorn that come a blustercatin' along with a
sled load o' pyrites, expectin' to start a stampede.</p>

<p>"But, ye're only delayed a bit. It's plain as
daylight, Waseche hit fer Eagle, an' ye'll come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with him, 'cause, chances is, he'll projec' round a
bit among the boys, an' if he figgers on a trip into
the hills he'll have to outfit fer it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jack," said the boy, offering his
small hand; "I'll sure remember what you told
me. I think I'll take a little nap and then
mush."</p>

<p>"That's the talk, son. Never mind unrollin'
yer bed, jes' climb into my bunk, yonder. It's
five days to Eagle, an' while ye're sleepin' I'll
jes' run through yer outfit an' see what ye
need, an' when ye wake up it'll be all packed an'
ready fer ye."</p>

<p>When Connie opened his eyes, daylight had
vanished and Black Jack sat near the stove reading
a paper-backed novel by the light of a tin reflector
lamp.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked the boy, as he fastened
his <i>mukluks</i>.</p>

<p>"'Bout 'leven G.M.," grinned the man.</p>

<p>"Why, I've slept twelve hours!" exclaimed the
boy in dismay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 597px;">
<img src="images/i-p067.jpg" width="597" height="658" alt="When Connie opened his eyes, daylight had vanished." title="When Connie opened his eyes, daylight had vanished." />
<span class="caption">&quot;When Connie opened his eyes, daylight had vanished.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, ye needed it, er ye wouldn't of slep' it,"
remarked the man, philosophically.</p>

<p>"But, look at the <i>time</i> I've wasted. I might
have been&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, son. Yere's another thing
ye've got to learn, an' that is: In this here country
a man's got to keep hisself fit&mdash;an' his dawgs, too.
Forcin' the trail means loosin' out in the long
run. Eight or ten hours is a day's work on the
trail&mdash;an' a good day. 'Course they's exceptions,
like a stampede or a rush fer a doctor when a man
c'n afford to take chances. But take it day in an'
day out, eight or ten hours'll git ye further than
eighteen or twenty.</p>

<p>"It's the <i>chechakos</i> an' the tin horns that excrootiates
theirselves an' their dawgs to a frazzle, an'
when a storm hits 'em, er they miss a cache, it's
good-night! Take an ol' sourdough an' he'll
jes' sagashitate along, eat a plenty an' sleep a
plenty an' do the like by his dawgs, an' when
trouble comes he jes' tightens his belt a hole er
two an' hits his dawgs couple extra licks fer
breakfas' an' exooberates along on his nerve.</p>

<p>"Eat yer supper, now, an' ye c'n hit the trail
whenever ye like. Yer sled's packed fer the trip
an' a couple days to spare."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came away in such a hurry I forgot to bring
my dust," said the boy, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess ye're good fer it," laughed the
man. "Wisht I had a thousan' on my books with
claims as good as yourn an' Waseche's."</p>

<p>After supper they harnessed the dogs and the
boy turned to bid his friend good-bye. The man
extended a buckskin pouch.</p>

<p>"Here's a poke with a couple hundred in it.
Take it along. Ye mightn't need it, an' then
agin ye might, an' if ye do need it, ye'll need it
bad." The boy made a motion of protest.</p>

<p>"G'wan, it's yourn. I got it all chalked up agin
ye, an' I'd have to change the figgers, an' if they's
anything on earth I hate, it's to bookkeep. So
long! When ye see Waseche Bill, tell him Black
Jack Demaree says ye can't never tell by the
size of a frog how fer he c'n jump."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE MEN OF EAGLE</p>


<p>Waseche Bill jogged along the main street of
Eagle, past log cabins, board shacks, and the
deceiving two-story fronts of one-story stores.
Now and then an acquaintance hailed him from
the wooden sidewalk, and he recognized others he
knew, among the small knots of men who stood
about idly discussing the meagre news of the camp.
At the Royal Palm Hotel, a long, low, log building
with a false front of boards, he swung in and,
passing around to the rear, turned his dogs into
the stockade.</p>

<p>In the office, seated about the stove, were a
dozen or more men, most of whom Waseche knew.
They greeted him loudly as he entered, and plied
him with a volley of questions.</p>

<p>"Where ye headed?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thought ye'd struck it rich on Ten Bow?"</p>

<p>"D'ye hear about Camaron Creek?"</p>

<p>The newcomer removed his heavy <i>parka</i> and
joined the group, answering a question here, and
asking one there.</p>

<p>"How's Sam Morgan's boy comin' on? We
heard how you an' him was pardners an' had a big
thing over on Ten Bow," inquired a tall man
whose doleful length of sallow countenance had
earned him the nickname of Fiddle Face. As he
talked, this man gnawed the end of his prodigiously
long mustache. Waseche's eyes lighted at the
mention of the boy.</p>

<p>"He's the finest kid eveh was, I reckon. Sma't
as a steel trap, an' they ain't nawthin' he won't
tackle. C'n cook a meal o' vittles that'd make yo'
mouth wateh, an' jest nach'lly handles dogs like
an ol' <i>tillicum</i>."</p>

<p>"How come ye ain't workin' yer claim?" asked
someone.</p>

<p>"It's this-a-way," answered Waseche, addressing
the group. "Mine's Discovery, an' his'n's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
One Below, an' we th'ow'd in togetheh. 'Bout
ten foot down, mine sloped off into his'n&mdash;run
plumb out. An' I come away so's the
kid'll have the claim cleah." A silence followed
Waseche's simple statement&mdash;a silence punctuated
by nods of approval and low-voiced mutterings
of "Hard luck," and "Too bad." Fiddle
Face was first to speak.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a <i>man</i>!" he exclaimed,
bringing his hand down on Waseche's shoulder
with a resounding whack.</p>

<p>"Won't ye step acrost to Hank's place an'
have a drink?" invited a large man, removing
his feet from the fender of the big stove, and
settling the fur cap more firmly upon his head.</p>

<p>"No thanks, Joe. Fact is, I ain't took a drink
fo' quite a spell. Kind o' got out o' the notion,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, sure seems funny to hear you refusin'
a drink! Remember Iditarod?" The man
smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, I recollect. An' I recollect that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ain't neveh got me nawthin' but misery an' an
empty poke. But, it ain't so much that. It's&mdash;well,
it's like this: Sam Mo'gan, he ain't heah
no mo' to look afteh the kid, an'&mdash;yo' see, the
li'l scamp, he's kind o' got it in his head that
they ain't no one jest like me&mdash;kind o' thinks
I really 'mount to somethin', an' what I say an'
do is 'bout right. It don't stand to reason I
c'n make him b'lieve 'taint no good to drink
licker, an' then go ahead an' drink it myself&mdash;does
it, now?"</p>

<p>"Sure don't!" agreed the other heartily. "An'
that's what <i>I</i> call a man!" And the whack that
descended upon Waseche's shoulder out-sounded
by half the whack of Fiddle Face.</p>

<p>After supper the men drifted out by twos and
threes for their nightly rounds of the camp's
tawdry places of amusement. Waseche Bill, declining
their invitations, sat alone by the stove,
thinking. The man was lonely. Until this
night he had had no time to realize how much
he missed his little partner, and his thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
lingered over the long evenings when they talked
together in the cabin, and the boy would read
aloud from the illustrated magazines.</p>

<p>A chair was drawn up beside his, and the man
called Joe laid a large hand upon his knee.</p>

<p>"This here Sam Morgan's boy&mdash;does he favour
Sam?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Like as two bullets&mdash;barrin' size," replied
Waseche, without raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you talked it over with the kid 'fore
you come away?" Waseche looked up.</p>

<p>"Why, no! I done left a lettah, an' come away
while he was sleepin'."</p>

<p>"D'ye think he'll stand fer that?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he's got to. Course, it'll be kind o'
hard on him, fust off, me'be. Same as me. But
it's bettah fo' him in the end. Why, his claim's
good fo' a million! An' the boys up to Ten
Bow, they'll see him through&mdash;McDougall, an'
Dutch Henry, an' the rest. They-all think as
much of the boy as what I do." The big man
at Waseche's side shook his head doubtfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know'd Sam Morgan well," he said, fixing the
other with his eyes. "He done me a good turn onct
an' he never asked no odds off'en no one. Now, if
the kid's jes' like him&mdash;s'pose he follers ye?"</p>

<p>"Cain't. He ain't got the dogs to."</p>

<p>The other smiled and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>"Where ye headin' fer, Waseche?" he asked,
after a few moments of silence.</p>

<p>"I aim to make a try fo' the Lillimuit."</p>

<p>"The Lillimuit!" exclaimed Joe. "Man, be
ye crazy?"</p>

<p>"No. They's gold theh. I seen the nuggets
Sven Carlson fetched back two ye'rs ago."</p>

<p>"Yes! An' where's Sven Carlson now?"</p>

<p>"I don'no."</p>

<p>"An' no one else don't know, neither. He's
dead&mdash;that's where he is! Leastwise, he ain't
never be'n heerd from after he started back fer
the Lillimuit."</p>

<p>"Want to go 'long?" asked Waseche, ignoring
the other's statement.</p>

<p>"Who? Me! Not on yer life I don't&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the Lillimuit! Not fer all the gold in the
world."</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon 'tain't so bad as folks claim."</p>

<p>"Claim! Folks ain't in no shape to claim!
They ain't no one ever come back, 'cept Carlson&mdash;an'
he was loco, an' went in agin&mdash;an' that's the
last of Carlson."</p>

<p>"What ails the country?" asked Waseche.</p>

<p>"They's talk of white Injuns, an' creeks that
don't freeze, an'&mdash;well, they don't no one really
know, but Carlson." The man shrugged and
glanced over his shoulder. "If I was you, I'd
hit the back trail. They's a plenty fer two in the
Ten Bow claim an' pardners is pardners."</p>

<p>Waseche ignored the suggestion:</p>

<p>"I'll be pullin' fer the Lillimuit in the mo'nin'.
Sorry ye won't jine me. I'll be rollin' in, now.
Good-night."</p>

<p>"So long! An' good luck to ye. I sure hate
to see ye go."</p>

<div class="p4" />

<p>Early in the evening of the fourth day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Waseche Bill's departure for the unknown Lillimuit
Connie Morgan swung McDougall's ten-dog team
into Eagle.</p>

<p>The boy, heeding the advice of Black Jack
Demaree, had curbed his impatience and religiously
held himself to a ten-hour schedule, and the
result was easily apparent in the way the dogs
dashed up the steep trail and swung into the well-packed
street of the big camp.</p>

<p>In front of a wooden building marked "Post
Office," he halted. A large man, just emerging
from the door, stared in amusement at the tiny
<i>parka</i>-clad figure that confronted him.</p>

<p>"Hello, son!" he called. "Where might you
be headin' fer?"</p>

<p>"I'm hunting for Waseche Bill," the youngster
replied. "Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"That'll be Scotty McDougall's team," observed
the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, but have you seen Waseche?"</p>

<p>"You'll be Sam Morgan's boy," the man
continued.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, come on along up to the <i>ho</i>tel."</p>

<p>"Is Waseche there?" eagerly inquired the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, no, he ain't jes' right there, this very
minute," replied the man, evasively.</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" asked the boy, with a
sudden fear in his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, jes' siyou'd out on a little prospectin'
trip. Come on, I'll give ye a hand with the dogs&mdash;supper'll
be about ready."</p>

<p>That evening Connie Morgan found himself
the centre of an interested group of miners&mdash;rough,
kindly men, who welcomed him warmly, asked
the news of Ten Bow, and recounted in awkward,
hesitating sentences stories of his father. Before
turning into the bunk assigned to him, the boy
sought out the proprietor of the hotel, who sat
in the centre of an interested group, discussing
local politics with a man from Circle.</p>

<p>"I'll pay my bill now, because I want to hit
the trail before breakfast," he said, producing
the well-filled pouch that Black Jack Dem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>aree
had thrust into his hand. Big Jim Sontag
chuckled way back in his beard as he regarded
his littlest guest.</p>

<p>"Go 'long, yo', sonny! Shove yo' poke in
yo' pocket. Yo' welcome to stop undeh my roof
long as yo' want to. Why, if I was to cha'ge yo'
fo' boa'd an' lodgin' afteh what yo' pap done
fo' me, up on Tillimik&mdash;hope the wolves'll eat
me, hide an' taller!"</p>

<p>The man called Joe came around the stove
and stood looking down at the boy.</p>

<p>"Look here, son, where you aimin' to hit fer
so early in the mornin'?"</p>

<p>"Why, to find Waseche, of course!" The
boy seemed surprised at the question.</p>

<p>"To the Lillimuit!" someone gasped, but
Joe silenced him.</p>

<p>"Son," he said, speaking slowly, "Waseche
Bill's struck out fer the Lillimuit&mdash;the country
where men don't come back from. Waseche's
a man&mdash;an' a good one. He knows what he's
up agin', an' if he wants to take a chanct that's his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
business. But, jes' between us, Waseche won't
come back." The boy's small shoulders stiffened
and his eyes flashed, as the little face uptilted to
look into the man's eyes.</p>

<p>"If Waseche don't come back, then I don't
come back either!" he exclaimed. "He's my
<i>pardner</i>! I've <i>got</i> to find him!"</p>

<p>"That's what I call a <i>man</i>!" yelled Fiddle
Face, bringing his fist down upon the table with a
bang.</p>

<p>"Jes' the same, sonny," continued Joe, firmly,
"we can't let ye go. We owes it to you, an' we
owes it to Sam Morgan. They's too many a
good man's bones layin' somewhere amongst them
fiendish peaks an' passes, now. No, son, you c'n
stay in Eagle as long as you like, an' welcome.
Or, you c'n hit the trail fer Ten Bow. But you
can't strike out fer the Lillimuit&mdash;<i>an' that goes</i>!"
There was finality in the man's tone, and one
swift glance into the faces of the others told the
boy that they were of the same mind, to a man.
For the first time in his life, Connie Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
faced the opposition of men. Instinctively he
knew that every man in the room was his friend,
but never in his life had he felt so helplessly
alone. What could one small boy do in the
face of the ultimatum of these men of the North?
Tears rushed to his eyes and, for a moment,
threatened to overflow upon his cheeks, but, in
that moment, there arose before him the face of
Waseche Bill&mdash;his "pardner." The little fists
clenched, the grey eyes narrowed, forcing back
the hot tears, and the tiny jaw squared to the
gritting of his teeth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;What could one small boy do in the face of the ultimatum of these men of the North?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Good-night," he said, and selecting a candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from among the many on top of the rude desk,
disappeared down the dark corridor between the
rows of stall-like rooms.</p>

<p>"Jes' fo' all the wo'ld like Sam Mo'gan,"
drawled big Jim Sontag. "I've saw <i>his</i> eyes
squinch up, an' his jaw clamp shut, that-a-way, a
many a time&mdash;an' nary time but somethin'
happened. We've shore got to keep an eye on
that young un, 'cause he aims to give us the slip
in the mo'nin'."</p>

<p>"Ye said somethin', then, Jim," agreed Fiddle
Face, gnawing at his mustache. "The kid's got
sand, an' he's game plumb through, an' when he
starts somethin' he aims to finish it&mdash;which like
his dad used to."</p>

<p>Connie Morgan, for all his tender years, knew
men. He knew, when he left the group about the
stove, that they would expect him to try to slip
out of Eagle, and that if he waited until morning
he would have no chance in the world of eluding
their vigilance. Minutes counted, for he also
knew that once on the trail, he need have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fear of pursuit; for no team in the Yukon country,
save only Dutch Henry's Hudson Bays, could
come anywhere near the trail record of McDougall's
ten gaunt <i>malamutes</i>.</p>

<p>Pausing only long enough in the little room
with its scrawling "No. 27" painted on the
door to wriggle into his <i>parka</i> and snatch his
cap from the bunk, he stole cautiously down the
narrow passage leading to the rear of the ell,
where a small door opened directly into the
stockade. With feverish haste he harnessed the
dogs and opened the gate. In the shadow of
the building he paused and peered anxiously up
and down the street. No one was in sight and,
through the heavily frosted windows of the buildings,
dull squares of light threw but faint illumination
upon the deserted thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"Mush! Mush!" he whispered, swinging the
long team out onto the hard-packed snow.</p>

<p>As he passed a store the door opened and
a man stood outlined in the patch of yellow
light. Connie's heart leaped to his throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
but the man only stared in evident surprise
that any one would be hitting the trail at that
time of night, and then the door closed and the
boy breathed again. He wished that he could
stop and lay in a supply of grub, but dared not
risk it. Better pay twice the price to some
prospector, or trapper, than risk being stopped.</p>

<p>Silently the sled glided over the smooth trail
and slanted out onto the river with Boris, Mutt,
and Slasher capering in its wake.</p>

<p>Connie had only a vague notion as to the
location of the unknown Lillimuit. He knew
that it lay somewhere among the unmapped
headwaters of Peel River, and that he must head
up the Tatonduk and cross a divide. Toward
morning he halted at the mouth of a river that
flowed in from the north-east. A little-used trail
was faintly discernible and the boy called the
old lead dog.</p>

<p>"Go find Waseche, Boris!" he cried, "go find
him!" Notwithstanding the fact that Waseche's
trail was nearly five days old, the old dog sniffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
at the snow and, with a joyous yelp, headed up
the smaller river.</p>

<p>The next morning there was consternation in
Eagle, and a half-dozen dog sleds hit the trail.
About ten miles up the Tatonduk, the men of
Eagle met a half-breed trapper with an empty
sled.</p>

<p>"Any one pass ye, goin' up?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>The trapper grinned.</p>

<p>"Yeste'day," he answered, "white man papoose";
he held his hand about four feet from the
snow. "Ten-dog team&mdash;Mush! Mush! Mush!
Go like de wolf! Stop on my camp. Buy all de
grub. Nev' min' de cost&mdash;hur' up! He try for
catch white man, go by four sleeps ago." Joe
cracked his whip and the dogs leaped forward.</p>

<p>"You no catch!" the half-breed shouted.
"Papoose, him go! go! go! Try for mak'
Lillimuit. Him no come back."</p>

<p>Disregarding the prediction of the half-breed,
Joe, Fiddle Face, and big Jim Sontag continued
their pursuit of the flying dog team, despite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
fact that as they progressed the trail grew colder.
After many days they came to the foot of the
great white divide and camped beneath overcast
skies, and in the morning a storm broke with
unbelievable fury.</p>

<p>Every man, woman, and child in eastern Alaska
remembers the great blizzard that whirled out
of the north on the morning of the third of
December and raged unabated for four days,
ceased as suddenly as it started, and then, for
four days more, roared terrifically into the north
again.</p>

<p>On the ninth day, the three men burrowed
from their shelter at the foot of a perpendicular
cliff. The trail was obliterated, and on every
hand they were confronted by huge drifts from
ten to thirty feet in height, while above them,
clinging precariously to the steep side of the
mountain that divided them from the dreaded
unknown, were vast ridges of snow that momentarily
threatened to tear loose and bury
them beneath a mighty avalanche.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Silently the men stared into each other's faces,
and then&mdash;silently, for none dared trust himself
to speak&mdash;these big men of the North harnessed
their dogs and began the laborious homeward
journey with heavy hearts.</p>

<div class="p4" />

<p>And, at that very moment, a small boy, eighty
miles beyond the impassable barrier of the snow-capped
divide, tunnelled through a huge drift
that sealed the mouth of an ice cavern in the side
of an inland glacier, and looked out upon the
bewildering tangle of gleaming peaks. Thanks
to the unerring nose of old Boris, and the speed
of McDougall's sled dogs, the trail of Waseche
had each day become warmer, and the night
before the storm, when Connie camped in the
convenient ice-cavern, he judged his partner to be
only a day ahead. When the storm continued
day after day, he chafed at the delay, but comforted
himself with the thought that Waseche
must also camp.</p>

<p>As he stood at the mouth of his cave gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at the unfamiliar mountains, towering range
upon range, with their peaks glittering in the cold
rays of the morning sun, old Boris crowded past
him and plunged into the unbroken whiteness of
the little valley. Round and round he circled
with lowered head. Up and down the jagged
ice wall of the glacier he ran, sniffing the snow and
whining with eagerness to pick up the trail that
he had followed for so many days. And as the
boy watched him, a sudden fear clutched at his
heart. For instead of starting off with short, joyous
yelps of confidence, the old dog continued his
aimless circling, and at length, as if giving up in
despair, sat upon his haunches, pointed his sharp
muzzle skyward, and lifted his voice in howl after
quavering howl of disappointment.</p>

<p>"The trail is buried," groaned the boy, "and
I had almost caught up with him!" He glanced
hopelessly up and down the valley, realizing for
the first time that the landmarks of the back trail
were obliterated. His eyes narrowed and he
gritted his teeth:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll find him yet," he muttered. "My Dad
always played in hard luck&mdash;but he never <i>quit</i>!
I'll find Waseche&mdash;but, if I don't find him, the
big men back there that knew Sam Morgan&mdash;they'll
know Sam Morgan's boy was no quitter,
either!" He turned away from the entrance and
began to harness the dogs.</p>

<div class="p4" />

<p>Way down the valley, high on the surface
of the glacier, Waseche Bill stopped suddenly to
listen. Faint and far, a sound was borne to his
ears through the thin, cold air. He jerked back
his <i>parka</i> hood and strained to catch the faint
echo. Again he heard it&mdash;the long, bell-like howl
of a dog&mdash;and as he listened, the man's face
paled, and a strange prickling sensation started
at the roots of his hair and worked slowly along his
spine. For this man of the North knew dogs.
Even in the white fastness of the terrible Lillimuit
he could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Boris! Boris!" he cried, and whirling his
wolf-dogs in their tracks, dashed over the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>swept
surface of the glacier in the direction of
the sound.</p>

<p>"I can't be wrong! I can't be wrong!" he
repeated over and over again, "I raised him from
a pup!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">IN THE LILLIMUIT</p>


<p>Speak <i>desolation</i>. What does it mean to you?
What picture rises before your eyes? A land laid
waste by the ravages of war? A brain picture of
sodden, trampled fields, leaning fences, grey
piles of smoking ashes which are the ruins of
homes, flanking a long, white, unpeopled highway
strewn with litter, broken wagons, abandoned
caissons, and, here and there, long fresh-heaved
ridges of brown earth that cover the men who
were? Isn't that the picture? And isn't it the
evening of a dull grey day, just at the time when
the gloom of twilight shades into the black pall
of night, and way toward the edge of the world,
on the indistinct horizon, a lurid red glow tints
the low-hung clouds&mdash;no flames&mdash;only the dull,
illusive glow that wavers and fades in the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
above other burning homes? Yes, that is desolation.
And, yet&mdash;men have been here&mdash;everything
about you speaks the presence of people.
Here people lived and loved and were happy;
and here, also, they were heartbroken and sad.
The whole picture breathes humanity&mdash;and the
inhumanity of men. And, as people have lived
here, instinctively you know that people will
live here again; for this is man-made desolation.</p>

<p>Only those to whom it has been given to know
the Big North&mdash;the gaunt, white, silent land
beyond the haunts of men&mdash;can realize the true
significance of <i>desolation</i>.</p>

<p>Stand surrounded by range upon towering
range of unmapped mountains whose clean-cut
peaks show clear and sharp through the keen
air&mdash;air so dry and thin that the slanting rays of
the low-hung midday sun gleam whitely upon the
outlines of ice crags a hundred miles away. Stand
there alone, enveloped by the solitude of the land
where men never lived&mdash;nor ever will live&mdash;where
the silence is a <i>thing</i>, pressing closer and closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
about you&mdash;smothering you&mdash;so that, instinctively,
you throw out your hands to push it
away that you may breathe&mdash;then you begin
to know desolation&mdash;the utter desolation of
the frozen wilderness, the cold, dead land of
mystery.</p>

<p>The long howl of the great grey wolf as he
lopes over the hunger trail is an eerie sound; so is
the cackling, insane laughter of a pack of coyotes in
the night-time, and the weird scream of the <i>loup-cervier</i>;
but of all sounds, the most desolate, the
sound that to the ears of man spells the last
word of utter solitude and desolation, is the
short, quick, single bark of the Arctic fox as he
pads invisible as a phantom in his haunts among
the echoing rim-rocks. Amid these surroundings,
brains give way. Not soften into maudlin
idiocy, but explode in a frenzy of violence, so that
men rush screaming before the relentless solitude;
or fight foolishly and to the death against the
powers of cold amid the unreal colours of the
aurora borealis whose whizzing hiss roars in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
ears when, at the last, they pitch forward into the
frozen whiteness&mdash;bushed!</p>

<p>This was the scene of desolation that confronted
Connie Morgan as McDougall's straining <i>malamutes</i>
jerked the sled from the ice-cavern that had
served as a shelter through all the days of the
great blizzard, when the wind-lashed snow, fine as
frozen fog, eddied and whirled across the surface
of the glacier which towered above him, and
drifted deep in the narrow pass.</p>

<p>The sled runners squeaked loudly in the flinty
snow, and Connie halted the dogs and surveyed
the forbidding landscape. Never in his life had
he been so utterly alone. For twenty days he
had followed the trail of Waseche Bill, and now
he stood at the end of the trail&mdash;worse than that,
for the high piled drifts that buried the trail of
Waseche covered his own back trail, completely
wiping out the one slender thread that connected
him with the land of men. He stood alone in
the dreaded Lillimuit! Before him rose a confusion
of mountains&mdash;tier after tier of naked peaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
clear and sharp against the blue sky. Fresh as
he was from the great Alaska ranges, the boy was
strangely awed by the vastness of it all. It was
unreal. He missed the black-green of the timber
belt that relieved the long sweep of his own mountains,
for here, from rounded foothill to topmost
pinnacle, the mountains were as bare of vegetation
as floating icebergs. The very silence was unnatural
and the boy's lips pressed tightly together
as thoughts of Ten Bow crowded his brain: the
windlass-capped shafts, the fresh dumps that
showed against the white snow of the valley; the
red flash and glow of the fires in the night that
thawed out the gravel for the next day's digging;
the rough log cabins ranged up and down the
gulch in two straggling rows&mdash;he could almost
hear the good-natured banter which was daily
exchanged across the frozen creek bed between
the rival residents of Broadway and "Fiff Avenue,"
as the two irregular "streets" of the camp were
named. He thought of his own cabin and the
long evenings with his big partner, Waseche Bill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sitting close to the roaring little "Yukon stove,"
puffing contentedly upon his black pipe, which he
removed now and then from between his lips to
judiciously comment upon the stories that the boy
read from the man-thumbed, coverless magazines
of other years, which had been passed from hand
to hand by the big men of the frozen places.</p>

<p>A lump came in his throat and he swallowed
hard, and as he looked, the naked peaks blurred
and swam together; and two hot, salty tears
stung his eyes. At the sting of the tears the little
form stiffened and the boy glanced swiftly about
him as, with a mittened hand, he dashed the
moisture from his eyes. The small fingers clenched
hard about the handle of the long-lashed, walrus
hide dog whip, and he stepped quickly to the gee-pole
of the sled.</p>

<p>"I'm a <i>piker</i>!" he cried, "a <i>chechako</i> and a
<i>kid</i> and a <i>tin-horn</i> and a <i>piker</i>! Crying like a
girl because I'm homesick! <i>Bah!</i> What would
Waseche say if he could see me now? And <i>Dad</i>?
<i>There</i> was a <i>man</i>! Sam Morgan!" The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
arms extended impulsively toward the great
white peaks and the big blue eyes glowed proudly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad! <i>Dad!</i> They call you unlucky!
But I'd rather have the big men back there
think of me like they talk of <i>you</i>, than to have
all the gold in the world!" He leaped suddenly
beyond the sled and shook a tiny clenched fist
toward the glittering crags.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> a piker!" he cried, fiercely. "I
couldn't be a piker, and be Sam Morgan's boy!
I got here in spite of the men of Eagle! And I'll
find Waseche, too! I'm not afraid of you! You
cold, white Lillimuit&mdash;with your big, bare, frozen
mountains, and your glaciers, and your stillness!
You can't bluff <i>me</i>! You may <i>get</i> me&mdash;but you
can't <i>turn</i> me! <i>I'm game!</i>"</p>

<p>As the voice of the boy thinned into the cold
air, Slasher, the gaunt, red-eyed wolf-dog, that
no man had ever tamed, ranged himself close
at his side and, with bristling hair and bared
fangs, added his rumbling, throaty growl to
Connie Morgan's defiance of the North.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>With a high-pitched whoop of encouragement
and a loud crack of the whip, the boy swung the
impatient ten-team to the westward and headed
it down the canyon into the very heart of the
Lillimuit. High mountains towered above him
to the left, and to the right the sheer wall of the
glacier formed an insurmountable barrier. The
dry, hard-packed snow afforded excellent footing
and McDougall's trained sled dogs made good
time as they followed the lead of old Boris who,
trotting in advance, unerringly picked the smoothest
track between the detached masses of ice and
granite that in places all but blocked the narrowing
gorge, into which the trail of Waseche Bill had
led on the first day of the great blizzard.</p>

<p>Mile after mile they covered, and as the walls
drew closer together the light dimmed, for the
slanting rays of the winter sun even at midday
never penetrated to the floor of the narrow canyon.
As he rounded a sharp bend, Connie halted the
dogs in dismay for, a short distance in front of
him, the ice-wall of the glacier slanted suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
against the granite shoulder of a high butte.
Wide eyed, he stared at the barrier. He was
in a blind pocket&mdash;a <i>cul-de-sac</i> of the mountains!
But where was Waseche? Weary and disappointed
the boy seated himself on the sled to
reason it out.</p>

<p>"There <i>must</i> be a way out," he argued. "I
didn't camp till the snow got so thick I couldn't
see, and he had to camp, too. If he doubled
back I would have seen him." He started to his
feet in a sudden panic. "I wonder if he did&mdash;while
I slept?" Then, as his glance fell upon the dogs,
he smiled. "You bet, he didn't!" he cried aloud,
"not with thirteen wolf-dogs camped beside the
trail. Slasher would growl and bristle up if a
man came within half a mile of us, and Waseche
could never get past old Boris." He remembered
the words of Black Jack Demaree: "Never set
up yer own guess agin' a good dog's nose."
Connie Morgan was learning the North&mdash;he
was trusting his dogs.</p>

<p>"There's a trail, somewhere," he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"and it's up to me to find it!" He cracked his
whip, but instead of leaping to the pull, the dogs
crouched quivering in the snow. The ground
trembled as in the throes of a mighty earthquake
and the boy whirled in his tracks as the canyon
reverberated to the crash of a thousand thunders.
He dashed to the point where, a few minutes
before, he had rounded the sharp angle of the
trail and gasped at the sight that met his gaze.
The weather-whitened ice of the glacier wall
was rent and shivered in a broad, green scar, and
in the canyon a mass of broken ice fifty feet high
completely blocked the back trail. He was
imprisoned! Not in a man-made jail of iron bars
and concrete&mdash;but a veritable prison of the
wilderness, whose impregnable walls of ice and
granite seemed to touch the far-off sky. The boy's
heart sank as he gazed upon the perpendicular
wall that barred the trail. For just an instant
his lip quivered and then the little shoulders
stiffened and the blue eyes narrowed as they had
narrowed that evening he faced the men of Eagle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"You didn't get me, Lillimuit!" he shouted.
"You'll have to shoot the other barrel!" His
voice echoed hollow and thin between the gloomy
walls, and he turned to the dogs. Old Boris, always
in search of a trail, sniffed industriously about the
base of the glacier. Big, lumbering Mutt, who
in harness could out-pull any dog in the Northland,
rolled about in the snow and barked foolishly in
his excitement. Slasher, more wolf than dog,
stood snarling his red-eyed hate in the face of the
new-formed ice barrier. And McDougall's <i>malamutes</i>,
wise in the ways of the snow trail, stood
alert, with eyes on the face of the boy, awaiting
his command.</p>

<p>Forty rods ahead, where the <i>cul-de-sac</i> terminated
in a great moraine, Connie could discern a
tangle of scrub growth and dead timber pushed
aside by the glacier. The short, three-hour day
was spent, and the gloomy walls of the narrow
gorge intensified the mysterious semi-darkness
of the long, sub-arctic night. The boy shouted
to the dogs, and the crack of his long whiplash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
echoed in the chasm like a pistol shot. At the
foot of the moraine he unharnessed and fed the
dogs, spread his robes in the shelter of a bold-faced
grey rock, and unrolled his sleeping bag.
He built a fire and thawed out some bannock, over
which he poured the grease from the pan of sizzling
bacon. Connie was hungry and he devoured
his solitary meal greedily, washing it down with
great gulps of steaming black coffee. After
supper, surrounded by the thirteen big dogs, he
made a hasty inspection of the walls of his prison.
The light was dim and he realized he would have
to wait until daylight before making anything
like a thorough examination; nevertheless, he was
unwilling to sleep until he had made at least one
effort to locate the trail to the outer world.</p>

<p>An hour later he crawled into his sleeping bag
and lay a long time looking upward at the little
stars that winked and glittered in cold, white
brilliance where the narrow panel of black-blue
showed between the towering walls of the canyon.</p>

<p>"I'll get out someway," he muttered bravely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i-p103.jpg" width="496" height="660" alt="My dad would have got out, and, you bet, so will I!" title="My dad would have got out, and, you bet, so will I!" />
<span class="caption">&quot;My dad would have got out, and, you bet, so will I!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I can't walk out, I'll <i>crawl</i> out, or <i>climb</i> out,
or <i>dig</i> out! My dad would have got out, and,
you bet, so will I! <i>He</i> wasn't afraid to tackle
<i>big</i> things&mdash;he was ready for 'em. What got him
was a <i>little</i> thing&mdash;just a little piece of loose ice
on a smooth trail&mdash;he wasn't <i>looking</i> for it&mdash;that's
all. But, at that, when he pitched head first
into Ragged Falls canyon that day, he died like a
<i>man</i> dies&mdash;in the big outdoors, with the mountains,
and the pine trees, and the snow! And that's
the way I'll die! If I never get out of this hole,
when they find me they won't find me in this
sleeping bag&mdash;'cause I'll work to the end of my
grub. I'll dig, and chop, and hack a way out till
my grub's gone, then I'll&mdash;I'll eat Mac's dogs&mdash;and
when they're gone I'll&mdash;No! By Jimminy!
I <i>won't</i> eat old Boris, nor Slasher, nor Mutt&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll
<i>starve first</i>!" He reached for the flap
of his sleeping bag, and as he drew it over his head
there came, faint and far from the rim-rocks, the
short, sharp bark of a starving fox.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">WASECHE BILL TO THE RESCUE</p>


<p>When Waseche Bill sent his dogs flying over the
surface of the glacier in answer to the bell-like
call of old Boris, he fully expected that the end of a
half-hour would find him at the dog's side. Sound
carries far in the keen northern air, and the man
urged his team to its utmost. As the sled runners
slipped smoothly over the ice and frozen snow,
his mind was filled with perplexing questions.
How came old Boris into the Lillimuit? Had he
deserted the boy and followed the trail of his old
master?</p>

<p>"No, no!" muttered the man. "He wouldn't
pull out on the kid, that-a-way&mdash;an', what's
mo', if he had, he'd of catched up with me long
befo' now."</p>

<p>Was it possible that the boy had taken the trail?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The man's brow puckered. What was it Joe said,
that night in Eagle?</p>

<p>"S'pose he follers ye?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't of!" argued Waseche. "It's
plumb onpossible, with them there three ol'
dawgs. An' he'd of neveh got past Eagle&mdash;Fiddle
Face, an' Joe, an' Jim Sontag, they wouldn't of
let him by&mdash;not fo' to go to the Lillimuit, they
wouldn't&mdash;not in a hund'ed yea's."</p>

<p>The dogs swerved, bringing the outfit to an
abrupt halt on the brink of a yawning fissure.
Waseche Bill scowled at the delay.</p>

<p>"Sho' some crevasse," he growled, as he peered
into the depths of the great ice crack fifty feet
wide, which barred his path. Suddenly his eye
lighted and he swung the dogs to the southward
where, a quarter of a mile away, a great white
snow bridge spanned the chasm in a glittering
arch. Seizing his axe, he chopped two parallel
trenches in the ice close to the end of the bridge.
Into these eight-inch depressions he worked the
runners of the heavily loaded sled, taking care that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the blunt rear end of the runners rested firmly
against the vertical ends of the trenches. Uncoiling
a long <i>babiche</i> line, he tied one end to the
tail rope of the anchored sled and, after making
the other end fast about his waist, ventured
cautiously out upon the snow bridge. Foot by
foot he advanced, testing its strength. The
bridge was wide and thick, and evidently quite
old and firm, but Waseche Bill was a man who took
no foolish risks.</p>

<p>Men who seek gold learn to face danger bravely&mdash;it
is part of the day's work&mdash;for death dogs close
upon the trail of the men of the North and must
be reckoned with upon short notice. Every
<i>tillicum</i> in the White Country, if he would, could
tell of hairbreadth escapes, and of times when a
clear brain and iron nerve alone stood between
him and the Great Beyond. But of these things
they rarely speak&mdash;for they know of the others,
like Sam Morgan, whose work is done, and whose
names are burned into the little wooden crosses
that dot the white snow of Aurora Land; and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
memory remains fresh in the haunts of the sourdoughs,
where their deeds are remembered long
and respected when the flash bravado of the reckless
tin-horn is scorned and forgotten.</p>

<p>Satisfying himself that the bridge would bear
the weight of the outfit, Waseche Bill untied the
rope and headed the dogs across at a run.</p>

<p>The surface of the glacier became rougher as he
advanced and Waseche was kept busy at the gee-pole
as the dogs threaded their way between ice
hummocks and made long detours to avoid cracks
and fissures, so that the winter sun was just sinking
behind the mountains when the man at last
found himself upon the edge of the glacier, at a
point some distance above the cave where Connie
Morgan had sought shelter from the storm.
He looked out over the undulating ridges of
snow waste that stretched away toward a nearby
spur of the mountains. Intently he scanned each
nook and byway of the frozen desert, but not a
moving object, not a single black dot that might
by any stretch of the imagination be construed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as a living thing, rewarded his careful scrutiny.
Gradually his eyes focused upon the point where
the mountains dipped toward the great ice field.</p>

<p>"Yonde's the mouth of the canyon I headed
into befo' the blizza'd. I'd bet a blue one the
old dawg's trailed me in." Filling his lungs
Waseche sent call after call quavering through the
still, keen air, but the only answer was the hollow
echoing of his own voice as it died away in the
mountains. A mile to the eastward he worked
his outfit into the valley, following the devious
windings of a half-formed lateral moraine, and
headed the dogs for the mouth of the canyon.</p>

<p>He searched in vain for tracks as he entered
the narrow pass. The snow was smooth and
untrampled as the driving wind of the blizzard
had left it.</p>

<p>"Sho' is queeah," he muttered. "Sweah to
goodness, I hea'd that Boris dawg&mdash;I'd know that
howl if I hea'd it in Kingdom Come&mdash;an' I know
it <i>now</i>! I wondeh," he mused, as the team
followed the devious windings of the canyon, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wondeh if this heah Lillimuit <i>is</i> a kind of spirit
land like folks says. Did I really heah the ol'
dawg howl, or has the big Nawth got me, too,
like it done got Carlson, an' the rest? 'Cause if
they was a dawg wheah's his tracks? An' if it
was a ghost dawg, how could he howl?" The
sled dogs paused, sniffing excitedly at the snow,
and Waseche Bill leaped forward. Before the
mouth of an ice-cavern were many tracks, and
the man stared dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Fo' the love of Mike!" he cried excitedly.
"It's the <i>kid</i>!" He dropped to his knees and
patted affectionately the impressions of the tiny
<i>mukluks</i>. "Boy! Boy! Yo' li'l ol' sourdough,
yo' li'l pa'dner&mdash;How'd yo' get heah? Yo' done
come, jes' as Joe 'lowed yo' would&mdash;yo' doggone
li'l <i>tillicum</i>! Come all alone, too! Jes' wait
'til I catch holt of yo'&mdash;an' McDougall's dawgs!
No one in Alaska could a loaned them <i>malamutes</i>
offen Mac, 'cept yo'&mdash;theah's ol' Scah Foot, that
lost two toes in the wolf-trap!" The man leaped
to the sled and cracked his whip.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mush! Mush!" he cried, and the dogs bounded
forward upon the trail of the boy.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill traversed this same canyon on
the day before the blizzard. He, too, had run
up against the dead end, and it was while retracing
his steps that he had discovered the sheep trail,
by means of which he gained the surface of the
glacier a mile back from the termination of the
gorge. He grinned broadly as his sled shot past
the foot of this trail, entirely obliterated, now,
by the new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>"I got yo', now, <i>kid</i>," he chuckled. "Holed
up like a silveh tip 'till the sto'm blowed by,
didn't yo', pa'dner? But I got yo' back ag'in, an'
from now on, me an' yo' sticks togetheh. I done
the wrong thing&mdash;to go' way&mdash;but yo' so plumb
li'l, I fo'got yo' was a sho' nuff man."</p>

<p>His soliloquy was cut short by the sudden
stopping of the sled as it bumped upon the heels
of the "wheel" dogs, and for the next few minutes
the man was busy with whip and <i>mukluks</i> straightening
out the tangle of fighting animals. Dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>ing
in the darkness between a huge granite block
and the wall of the glacier, they had brought up
sharply against the new-formed ice barrier that
completely blocked the trail.</p>

<p>Slashing right and left with his heavy whip,
and kicking vigorously and impartially, he finally
succeeded in subduing the fighting dogs and
removing the tangled harness. And then he
stared dumbly at the great mass of broken ice
that buried the trail of the boy. In the darkness
he could form no conception of the extent of the
barrier. Was it a detached fragment? Or had
the whole side of the glacier split away and
crashed into the canyon? Before his eyes rose
the picture of a small body crushed and mangled
beneath thousands of tons of ice, and for the
first time in his life Waseche Bill gave way to
his emotions. Sinking down upon the sled he
buried his face in his hands and in the darkness,
surrounded by the whimpering dogs, his great
shoulders heaved to the violence of his sobs.</p>

<p>The great mass of ice that split from the glacier's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
side, while presenting an unscalable face to the
imprisoned boy, was by no means so formidable
a barrier when approached from the opposite side.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill was not the man to remain long
inactive. After a few moments he sprang to his
feet and surveyed the huge pile of ice fragments.
By the feeble light of the stars he could see that
the walls of the canyon towered high above the
top of the mass. Tossing his dogs an armful of
frozen fish, he caught up the coil of <i>babiche</i> rope
and stepped to the foot of the obstruction.</p>

<p>"I cain't wait till mawnin'," he muttered, "I
got to find out if the kid is safe. Reckon I c'n
make it, but I sho' do wish they was mo' light."</p>

<p>It was not a difficult climb for a man used to the
snow trails, and a half hour later Waseche Bill
stood at the top and, with a long sigh of relief,
gazed into the depths beyond the barrier.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lawd, it's only a slivah!" he exclaimed.
"But, at that, it mout of catched him."
With a kick he sent a small fragment of ice spinning
into the chasm. Almost instantly, the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
heard a low growl, and his eye caught the flash
of an indistinct grey shape against the snow floor
below him. Straight as an arrow the shape shot
toward the ice wall, and Waseche Bill heard the
scratching of claws upon the flinty surface, and a
low, throaty growl as the shape dropped back into
the snow. He laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Oh, yo' Slashah dawg!" he cried happily, as
he proceeded to make the end of his long line fast
to a projecting pinnacle.</p>

<p>"I'll jes' slip down an' s'prise the kid," he
chuckled, "he's prob'ly rolled in by now." Taking
a couple of turns about his leg with the rope, he
lowered himself over the edge and slid slowly
downward. Suddenly, he gripped hard and
checked his descent. He was ten feet from the
bottom, and something struck the rope just
beneath his feet, and as it struck, he heard again
the low growl, and the vicious click of fang on
polished fang, and the soft thud with which the
wolf-dog struck the snow.</p>

<p>"Hey, yo' Slashah!" he called sharply. "Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
lay down! It's only me, Slashah&mdash;don't yo'
know me?" For answer the dog sprang again,
and the man hastily drew himself higher&mdash;for
this time the long white fangs clashed together
almost at his feet, and the low growl ended in a
snarl as the grey body dropped back upon the
snow.</p>

<p>"Doggone yo'! Quit yo' foolin'! Git out!"
cried the exasperated man, as he tightened his
grip on the swaying line. And then, beneath
him, the canyon seemed filled with dogs&mdash;gaunt,
grey shapes that sprang, and snapped, and growled,
and fell back to spring again.</p>

<p>"Now, what d'yo' think of that," muttered the
man disgustedly, as he peered downward into
green glaring eyes and slavering jaws. "Mac's
dawg's, too! I'd sho' hate fo' this heah rope to
break! Theh's ol' Boris!" he exclaimed, as the
lead dog appeared at the edge of the snarling
pack. "Hello, Boris, ol' dawg! Yo' know me&mdash;don't
yo', Boris?" With a short, sharp yelp of
delight, the dog dashed in and leaped toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his old master, but his activity served only to
egg on the others, and they redoubled their
efforts to reach the swaying man. Waseche Bill
laughed:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/i-p116.jpg" width="530" height="654" alt="Now, what d'yo' think of that! I'd sho' hate fo' this heah rope to break!" title="Now, what d&#39;yo&#39; think of that! I&#39;d sho&#39; hate fo&#39; this heah rope to break!" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Now, what d&#39;yo&#39; think of that! I&#39;d sho&#39; hate fo&#39; this heah rope to break!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'Taint no use. Reckon I'll have to wake up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the kid." And the next moment the walls of the
canyon rang with his calls for help.</p>

<p>At the other end of the chasm Connie Morgan
stirred uneasily and thrust his head from under the
flap of his sleeping bag. He listened drowsily
to the pandemonium of growls and yelps and
snarls, from the midst of which came indistinctly
the sound of a voice. He became suddenly
wide-awake and, wriggling from the bag,
caught up his dog whip and sped swiftly up
the canyon.</p>

<p>It was no easy task for the boy to beat the
excited dogs into submission, but at length they
slunk away before the stinging sweep of the lash,
and Waseche Bill, his hands numb from his long
gripping of the rope, slid squarely into the up-reaching
arms of his little partner.</p>

<p>"Yo' sho' saved my bacon that time, kid.
Why, that theah Slashah dawg&mdash;he'd of et me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
alive, an' the rest w'd done likewise, onct they got
sta'ted!" Waseche Bill's tongue rattled off the
words with which he sought to disguise the real
emotion of his heart at finding the boy he had
learned to love, safe and sound in the great white
wilderness. But Connie Morgan was not deceived,
and he smiled happily into the rough hair
of his big partner's <i>parka</i>, as the man strained
him to him in a bearlike embrace.</p>

<p>That night the two sat long over the camp fire at
the foot of the moraine, and the heart of the man
swelled with pride as the boy recounted his adventures
on the trail.</p>

<p>"And now I've found you," concluded the boy,
"I'm going to take you back. Pardners are
pardners, you know&mdash;and tomorrow we'll hit for
Ten Bow."</p>

<p>The man turned his face away and became
busily engaged in arranging the robes into a bed
close against the boy's sleeping bag.</p>

<p>"We sho' will, kid. Pa'dners <i>is</i> pa'dners,
an'&mdash;me an' yo'&mdash;somehow&mdash;I cain't jes' say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
it&mdash;but&mdash;anyways&mdash;Why! Doggone it! Me an'
yo's mo'n jes pa'dners&mdash;ain't we, kid?"</p>

<p>Later, as the man burrowed deep into his
robes a voice sounded drowsily from the depths
of the sleeping bag:</p>

<p>"Waseche!"</p>

<p>"Huh?" questioned the man.</p>

<p>"Black Jack Demaree said to tell you&mdash;let's
see&mdash;what was it he said? Oh, yes&mdash;he said
when I found you to tell you that 'you can't
tell by the size of a frog how far he can jump.'"</p>

<p>Waseche Bill chuckled happily to himself:</p>

<p>"Yo' sho' cain't," he agreed. "Black Jack's
right about that&mdash;trouble is, I nevah know'd
much about frawgs."</p>
<div class="p6" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE WHITE DEATH</p>


<p>It was yet dark when Waseche Bill opened his
eyes and blinked sleepily into the small face that
smiled down at him in the light of the flickering
fire. The rich aroma of boiling coffee and the
appetizing odour of bacon roused him to his
senses and he grinned happily at the words of the
boy:</p>

<p>"Come on, pardner, grub's ready! And you
better fly at it, too. 'Cause if I know anything
about it, we'll sure know we've done something
by the time we get the outfit out of this
hole."</p>

<p>Waseche glanced upward where the tiny stars
winked coldly between the high walls of the gloomy
gorge in which Sam Morgan's boy found himself
held prisoner when the huge mass of ice detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
itself from the side of the glacier and crashed into
the canyon.</p>

<p>"Yo' sho's on the job, son&mdash;seem's if I jest got
good an' asleep. What time is it?" he asked, as
he crawled from beneath his robes.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock," answered the boy extending a
cup of steaming coffee.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock! Sufferin' cats! Three hours
till daylight&mdash;Ain't yo got no pity on the ol'
man?"</p>

<p>"Old man, nothing!" grinned Connie over the
rim of his tin cup. "But if you wait for daylight
to come down into the bottom of this well, you
will be an old man before you get out."</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the two packed the outfit and,
without harnessing the dogs, pulled the sled to the
foot of the barrier. Here it was unloaded and the
pack made into bundles suitable for hoisting.
The sled was the heaviest piece and the only one
that offered a serious problem. It was decided
that Connie should remain below and make the
things fast, while Waseche climbed to the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and did the hoisting. A sling was rigged from a
strip of old blanket, by means of which the dogs
could be lifted, by passing it under their bellies
and fastening it to the rope at their backs. When
all was ready Waseche grasped the swaying
<i>babiche</i> line, by means of which he had lowered
himself the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Cain't grip nothin' with mittens on," he
grumbled, as he bared his hands to the intense
cold. Next moment he was pulling himself jerkily
upward, hand over hand, while Connie Morgan
stood below and watched the indistinct outline
of the man who swayed and dangled above him,
for all the world like a giant spider ascending a
thread of invisible web.</p>

<p>The rope twitched violently as the man drew
himself onto the top of the barrier, and a few minutes
later the regular taps of his ice axe sounded,
as Waseche chopped his "heel holts" as close to
the edge as safety permitted. The tapping ceased
and the voice of the man rolled and reverberated
between the walls of the cistern-like chasm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"All set, kid!"</p>

<p>"Haul away!" and immediately the bale
containing the two sleeping bags swung clear of
the snow and was drawn upward, spinning and
bumping the ice wall. Other bales followed and
soon there remained only the dogs and the sled.
After many unsuccessful efforts to induce the wolf-dogs
to submit to the unaccustomed sling, Connie
hit upon the expedient of harnessing them to the
sled, for even McDougall's finely trained dogs,
like all <i>malamutes</i>, were wolves at heart and
were trustworthy and tractable only in harness.
This accomplished, they submitted readily enough
and, beginning with the "wheel dogs," one at a
time, Connie passed the sling about them and
cast off the harness at the same time. Waseche
hauled them, snarling and biting at the encircling
band, up the face of the perpendicular wall. Old
Boris and good-natured Mutt submitted without
a growl of protest; but it was different with the
untamed savage Slasher. During the whole
unusual proceeding the suspicious wolf-dog had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bristled and growled, and several times it was only
by the narrowest margin that Connie succeeded
in averting a tragedy, as Slasher leaped with
flashing fangs toward a sled dog dangling helplessly
from the rope's end. At last Slasher alone remained.
The boy called him. He came, with
hair abristle, stepping slowly and stiffly. His
eyes glared red, and way back in his throat
rumbled long, low growls.</p>

<p>"Come on! You can't bluff <i>me</i>&mdash;you old
grouch, you!" laughed the boy, and stooping,
slipped a heavy collar about his neck. Passing a
running noose about the long pointed muzzle, he
secured the free end to the collar, and to make
assurance doubly sure, he tied a strip torn from
the old blanket tightly about the dog's jaws,
affixed the sling, and gave the signal.</p>

<p>It was not for his own protection that the boy
thus muzzled Slasher. In all the Northland he
was the only person who did not fear the wild,
vicious brute, for he knew that rather than harm
him the <i>malamute</i> would have allowed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to be torn in pieces. But he feared for Waseche
Bill when he came to release him. Despite the
fact that he had lived with Waseche for a year,
the dog treated him no whit differently than he
treated the veriest stranger. To one person in all
the world&mdash;and only one&mdash;the wolf-dog owed
allegiance, and that person was Connie Morgan&mdash;the
first and only creature of the hated man tribe
who had used him with fairness.</p>

<p>Again the line was lowered and Connie, making
his own line fast to the sled, grasped the loose end,
seated himself in the loop of Waseche's, and gave
the signal. Up, up, he rose, fending off from the
wall with feet and hands. At length he reached
the top and the strong arms of Waseche helped
him over the edge. After a brief rest, both laid
hold of the remaining line and hauled away at
the sled. The pull taxed their combined strength
to the utmost, but the heavy sled was up at last,
and they stood free upon the top of the barrier.</p>

<p>Their labours had consumed the greater part of
the day, and it was well after noon when they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
down to a hasty lunch of caribou <i>charqui</i> and
suet.</p>

<p>"I would never have made it!" exclaimed the
boy, thoughtfully, as his eyes travelled over the
perpendicular walls of the yawning chasm. "Put
her there, pardner," he said, gravely extending
his hand toward Waseche. The man grasped
the small, mittened hand and wrung it hard:</p>

<p>"Sho' now! Sho' now!" he protested hastily.
"Yo' mout of." But the boy noticed that
Waseche turned from the place with a shudder.</p>

<p>The work of packing the outfit down into the
canyon occupied the remainder of the day and
that night they camped at the foot of the barrier,
where Waseche had left his own outfit.</p>

<p>"Now for Ten Bow! I sure do love every
log and daub of chinking in that cabin. When
fellows own their own home&mdash;like we do&mdash;when
they built it with their own hands, you know&mdash;a
fellow gets homesick when he's away&mdash;'specially
if he's all alone. Didn't you get homesick, too,
pardner?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Waseche Bill dropped the harness he was
untangling, and stepping to the boy's side, laid a
big hand upon the small shoulder:</p>

<p>"Yes, kid," he answered, in a soft voice, "I
be'n homesick every minute I be'n gone. An'
that night&mdash;jest befo' I left, I was homesickest of
all. I thought it was the squa'h thing to do&mdash;but
I've learnt a heap since, that I didn't know
then. Tell me, son, if yo' love the cabin so, why
did yo' come away? The claim was yo'n. I
wrote it out that way a purpose." The clear
grey eyes of the boy looked up into the man's
face.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, after you were gone, it&mdash;it wasn't
the same any more. I&mdash;I <i>hated</i> the place. Maybe
it's because I'm only a boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted the man, speaking slowly,
as if to himself. "Yo' only a boy&mdash;jest a little
boy&mdash;an' yet&mdash;" his voice became suddenly husky,
and he turned away: "Folks calls Sam Mo'gan
<i>unlucky</i>!" He cleared his throat loudly, and
again the big hand rested on the boy's shoulder:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen, kid, I've had cabins befo' now&mdash;a many
a one, on big creeks an' little&mdash;an' I've come off
an' left 'em all, an' neveh a onct was I homesick.
But this time I was&mdash;it was diffe'nt. Shucks,
kid, don't yo' see? It takes mo'n jest a cabin
to make&mdash;<i>home</i>."</p>

<p>Soon the outfits were ready for the trail.</p>

<p>"We sho' got dawgs enough," grinned Waseche,
as he eyed the two teams; "McDougall's ten,
eight of mine, an' them three of yo'n&mdash;we betteh
mush, too, 'cause it takes a sight of feed fo' twenty-one
dawgs. I 'lowed to run acrost meat befo'
now&mdash;caribou, or moose, or sheep&mdash;but this heah
Lillimuit's as cold an' dead as the outeh voids
that the lecture felleh was tellin' about in Dawson.
I got right int'rested in the place&mdash;till I come to
find out it was too fah off to botheh about, bein'
located way oveh back of the sun somewheahs."</p>

<p>At a crack of the whip, Waseche's dogs sprang
into the lead, and McDougall's <i>malamutes</i>, with
Connie trotting beside them, swung in behind.
There was no wind, and in the narrow canyon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sounds were strangely magnified. The squeak
of sled runners on the hard, dry snow sounded
loud and sharp as the creak of a windlass, and,
as they passed the foot of the snow-covered sheep
trail, the voice of Waseche boomed and reverberated
unnaturally:</p>

<p>"Yondeh's the ol' sheep trail wheah I got out of
the canyon. Neah's I c'n make out it ain't be'n
used fo' mo'n a month. I tell yo' what&mdash;times
is sho' hawd when the sheep pulls out of a country."</p>

<p>It was very cold. Toward midday the windings
of the canyon allowed them occasional glimpses
of the low-hung sun. It had a strange unfamiliar
appearance, like a huge eye of polished brass,
glaring coldly in a bright white light not its own.
As each turn of the trail cut off his view, the boy
glanced furtively at his partner and was quick to
note the man's evident uneasiness. Mile after
mile they mushed in silence. The fragmentary
conversation of the earlier hours ceased, and each
experienced a growing sense of exhaustion. The
motionless air hung heavy and dead about them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Its vitality was wanting, so that they were forced
to breathe rapidly and concentrate their minds
upon the simple act of keeping up with the dogs.
Each was conscious of a growing lethargy that
sapped his strength. Even the dogs were affected,
and plodded mechanically forward with lowered
heads and drooping tails.</p>

<p>They were approaching the cavern in which
Connie had sought refuge from the blizzard. For
several miles the boy had been wondering whether
Waseche would camp at the cave. He hoped
that he would. He was growing terribly sleepy
and it was only by constant effort that he kept
his eyes open, although they had been scarcely
five hours on the trail. His head felt strangely
light and hollow, and white specks danced before
his eyes. He closed his eyes and the specks were
red. They danced in the darkness, writhing and
twisting like fiery snakes. He opened his eyes
and held doggedly to his place beside the team.
His mind dwelt longingly upon the soft, warm
feel of his sleeping bag. The boy's nerves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
tense and strained, so that his lips and eyelids
twitched spasmodically, with a sting as of extreme
cold.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer the mouth of the cavern
he felt that he would scream aloud if Waseche
did not halt. His gaze became fixed upon the
broad back of his partner as he mushed beside
his dogs, and he noted that the man walked with
quick, jerky steps. He wondered vaguely at this,
for it was not Waseche's way. This passing
thought vanished, and again his mind reverted
to the all-important question: would Waseche
camp? He would ask him. He filled his lungs&mdash;then,
suddenly the thought flashed through
his brain: "I'm a <i>piker!</i> I won't ask him&mdash;I'll
drop in my tracks first." The deep breath
stung his lungs and he coughed&mdash;a sharp, dry
cough that rasped his throat. The man turned
at the sound and eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>"Keep yo' mouth shut! An' hurry&mdash;<i>hurry!</i>"
The man's voice was low and hard, and he, too,
coughed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>At the mouth of the cavern the dogs stopped of
their own accord and lay down in harness. The
boy noted this, and also that instead of waiting
alert, with cocked ears and watchful eyes for a
word of command, they lay with their pointed
muzzles pressed close against the hard snow, as if
fearing to move.</p>

<p>Swiftly and silently Waseche began to remove
the harness from the dogs and Connie followed his
example. As soon as a dog was released, instead
of rolling about and ploughing and rooting his
snout into the snow, he slunk quickly into the cave.
The hitches were cast loose and sleeping bags,
robes, grub, and frozen fish for the dogs were
carried into the cavern. Waseche made another
trip into the canyon while the boy sank down
upon his rolled sleeping bag and stared stupidly
at the dogs huddled together in the farther end
of the cave, their eyes gleaming greenly in the
darkness. A quarter of an hour later the man
returned with a huge armful of gnarled, grubby
brushwood that he had hacked from the crevices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the rocks. Near the entrance he built a small
fire, filled the coffeepot with snow, and thawed
some pemmican in the frying pan. He filled his
pipe, threw a handful of coffee into the pot, and
turned toward Connie. The boy had fallen asleep
with his back against the ice wall. Waseche
shook him gently:</p>

<p>"Wake up, son! Grub pile!" He stirred
uneasily and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Let me alone," he muttered, sleepily, "I'm
not hungry."</p>

<p>"Yo' got to eat. Heah's some hot coffee&mdash;jest
climb outside of this, an' then yo' c'n sleep
long as yo' like."</p>

<p>The hot liquid revived the boy and he ate some
pemmican and bannock. Having finished, he
spread his robes and unrolled his sleeping bag.
Before turning in, however, he stepped to the
door and looked out. He was surprised that it
was yet daylight and the sun hung just above the
shoulder of a sharp, naked peak. Again the white
spots danced before his eyes, and he turned quickly:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look! Look at the sun!" he cried in a sudden
panic. "One, two, three, four&mdash;look Waseche,
I can't count 'em."</p>

<p>"Come away, kid," said the man at his side,
pulling at his sleeve.</p>

<p>"But the suns! Look! Can you count them?"</p>

<p>"No, kid, we cain't count 'em." The man's
voice was very low.</p>

<p>"But what is the matter? There is only one
real sun! Where do they come from?"</p>

<p>"I do'no, I do'no. It's&mdash;we got to camp heah
till&mdash;" He was interrupted by the boy:</p>

<p>"It's what?" he asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;I neveh seen it befo'&mdash;but I've hea'd tell&mdash;It's
the <i>white death</i>. Heah, in the Lillimuit,
an' some otheh places&mdash;nawth of the Endicotts,
some say. Tonight&mdash;the flashin' lights, an' the
blood-red aurora&mdash;tomorrow, a thousan' suns in
the sky. They ain't no wind, an' the air is dead&mdash;dead,
an' so cold yo' lungs'll crackle an' split
if yo'r caught on the trail. We got to keep out
of it, an' then&mdash;" His voice trailed into silence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then <i>what</i>?" asked the boy, drowsily.</p>

<p>"I do'no, I do'no, kid&mdash;that depends."</p>

<p>Connie Morgan was awakened by the whimpering
of dogs. In his ears was a strange sound like
the hiss of escaping steam. He wondered, drowsily,
how long he had slept, and lay for some moments
trying to collect his senses. The sounds in the
night terrified him&mdash;filled him with an unnamed
dread. The strange hissing was not continuous,
but broken and interrupted by a roaring crackle,
like the sound of a burning forest. But there was
no forest&mdash;only ice and snow, and the glittering
peaks of ranges. With a trembling hand he
raised the hood of his sleeping bag and peered
cautiously out. To the boy's distorted imagination
the whole world seemed on fire. The
interior of the cave glowed dimly with a dull red
light, while beyond the entrance the snow flashed
brilliant lights of scarlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">Connie Morgan &quot;stared spellbound at the terrible splendour of the

</div>

<p>"Don't get scairt, son. It's only the aurora.
It's like they said&mdash;Carlson, an' one or two mo'
I've hea'd talk. The blood-red aurora in the
night time, an' the thousan' suns in the day."
Waseche's sleeping bag was close against his own,
and the sound of his voice reassured the terrified
boy. Together, in silence, they watched the awful
spectacle. Red lights&mdash;scarlet, crimson, vermilion
flashed upon the snow, and among the far-off
peaks which stood out distinctly above the
farther wall of the long stretch of canyon that
their viewpoint commanded. Upon the green ice
at the entrance to the cavern the lights showed
violet and purple. The boy stared spellbound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at the terrible splendour of the changing lights,
while above the hiss and crackle of the aurora
he could hear the whimpering and moaning of
the terrified dogs. He shrank back into his
sleeping bag, pulling the flap tight to keep out the
awful sights and sounds, and lay for hours waiting
for something to happen. But nothing did happen
and when he awoke again it was day. The dogs
had ceased to whine, and Waseche Bill was moving
about in the cave. The man had hung a robe
over the entrance, but around the edges Connie
could see narrow strips of light. The air was
oppressive and heavy. His head ached. The
acrid smell of smoke permeated the interior of
the cavern and Connie wriggled from his sleeping
bag and, while Waseche busied himself with
the coffee and bacon, he broke out a bale of fish
for the dogs.</p>

<p>"Cut 'em down to half ration, son," warned
the man, eyeing the scanty supply. "We got
to get out of this heah Lillimuit&mdash;an' we got to
get out on what we got with us. I don't reckon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they's a livin' critteh in the whole blame country,
'cept us, an' we got to go easy on the grub."</p>

<p>"I heard a fox bark the other night," ventured
the boy.</p>

<p>"Yo' won't get fat on fox bahks," grinned the
man, "an' that's all the clost yo' even get to 'em.
Outside of white goats, them foxes is about the
hah'dest vahmint to get a shot at they is."</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to hit the trail?" asked the
boy in evident surprise, when, after breakfast,
instead of packing the outfit, Waseche lighted
his pipe and stretched out on a robe.</p>

<p>"Not <i>this</i> day, we ain't," replied the man;
"An' me'be not tomorrow&mdash;if the wind don't
come. Do yo' know how fah we'd get today?"</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"I do'no&mdash;a hund'ed steps, me'be&mdash;me'be half a
mile&mdash;'twouldn't be fah."</p>

<p>"Tell me what's the matter, Waseche. What's
going to happen? And why have you closed up
the door?"</p>

<p>"It's the <i>white death</i>," answered the man in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
awed tone. "Nothin' won't happen if we stay
inside. I've hea'd it spoke of, only I somehow&mdash;I
neveh believed it befo'. As fo' the robe&mdash;hold
yo' breath an' peek out through that crack along
the aidge. Hold yo' breath, mind&mdash;<i>don't breathe that air!</i>"</p>

<p>Connie filled his lungs and drew back the edge of
the robe. Instantly his face seemed seared by the
points of a million red-hot needles. He scarcely
noticed the pain, for he was gazing in awestruck
wonder where a thousand suns seemed dancing in
the cloudless sky. As upon the previous day, the
air was filled with dancing white specks, and the
suns glared with a glassy, yellow brightness.
They looked wet and shiny, but their light seemed
no brighter than the light of a single sun. No
blue sky was visible, and the mountain peaks,
even the nearer ones, were nowhere to be seen.
The whole world seemed enveloped in a thick
haze of sickly yellow.</p>

<p>He let go the edge of the robe and drew back
from the opening.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee whiz! but it's cold," he exclaimed,
rubbing his stinging cheeks. "How cold is it,
pardner?" For answer Waseche shifted his
position, reached swiftly beneath the bottom of
the robe, and withdrew from the outside a small
spirit thermometer which he held up for the boy's
inspection. It was frozen solid!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE <i>IGLOO</i> IN THE SNOW</p>


<p>"Now, kid," said Waseche Bill the following
morning, "we got to make tracks fo' the Tatonduk.
We got too many dogs, an' we got to cut
down on the feed. I hate to do it&mdash;on the trail&mdash;but
they's no two ways about it. Three or fo'
days ort to put us at the divide. I made a <i>cache</i>
the'h comin' in an' we'll be all right when we strike
it."</p>

<p>The two stood in front of the cavern, breathing
deeply of the clear, pure air. A stiff breeze was
blowing from the south-west, and the day was
warm and pleasant. The sun had not yet risen,
and as the dogs swung into the trail Connie
glanced at the little thermometer lashed firmly to
the back of his sled. It registered twenty degrees
below zero, an ideal temperature for trail travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and the boy cracked his whip and yelled aloud
in the very joy of living.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the canyon they swerved in a
north-westerly direction, toward the northernmost
reach of the Ogilvie Range. All day they mushed
across the wide caribou barrens and flat tundra
that separated the great nameless range behind
them from the high mountains to the westward
that lay between them and Alaska. For, upon
ascending the Tatonduk, they had passed out of
Alaska into the unmapped Yukon district of sub-arctic
Canada. Evening of the second day
found them among the foothills of the mountains.
Patches of stunted timber appeared and the lay of
the land forced them to keep to the winding beds
of frozen creeks and rivers. The end of the next
day found them camped on the snow-covered ice
of a small river. Waseche divided the few remaining
fish, threw half of them to the dogs, and sat
down beside the boy, who had prepared a meal of
caribou <i>charqui</i> and coffee:</p>

<p>"Seems like this <i>must</i> be the creek&mdash;but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ain't sho'. I thought the one we tackled yeste'day
was it, too&mdash;but it petered out on us."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Connie, "I thought I'd
remember the back trail, but since the big snow
everything looks different. And I was in an awful
hurry to catch up with you, besides."</p>

<p>"Sho', kid, I know. I'd ort to took mo' pains
myself, but I wasn't so pa'ticlah about gettin'
back&mdash;then. Anyways, we'll try this one. We
got to watch the grub now, fo' sho'. Them
<i>malamutes</i> is hongry! Day afteh tomorrow, if
we don't find the <i>cache</i>, we'll have to kill a dawg."
Connie nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll find it, all right. This looks like the
creek. Still, so do they all," he added reflectively.</p>

<p>The next day was a repetition of the day preceding.
They followed the bed of the creek to its
source in a narrow canyon which lost itself upon
the steep side of a gigantic mountain. Wearily,
they retraced their steps and once again among
the foothills, turned to the northward.</p>

<p>"They's no dodgin' the truth, son," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Waseche gloomily, as they mushed on, scrutinizing
the mouths of creeks in a vain endeavour to locate
a landmark. "We're lost&mdash;jest na'chly plumb
<i>lost</i>&mdash;like a couple of <i>chechakos</i>."</p>

<p>"The divide's <i>somewhere</i>," answered the boy,
bravely. "We'll find it."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's somewhe'h. But how many thousan'
of these creeks, all jest alike, do yo' reckon
they is? An' how about grub?"</p>

<p>"I hate to kill a dog," the boy said.</p>

<p>"So do I, but the rest has got to eat. I know
them wolf-dawgs; onct they get good an' hongry
they'll begin tearin' one another up&mdash;then they'll
lay fo' <i>us</i>&mdash;folks is meat, too, yo' know."</p>

<p>Night overtook them on a small wooded plateau
and they camped in the shelter of a dense thicket
of larch and stunted spruce. At the very edge of
the thicket was a low white mound, its crown
rising some three or four feet above the surrounding
level. The sleds were drawn up at
the foot of this mound, the dogs unharnessed, and,
unslinging his axe, Waseche Bill went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
thicket for firewood, leaving Connie to unpack the
outfit. The boy noted as he spread the robes
that the mound was singularly regular, about
twelve feet in diameter at the base and having
evenly rounded sides&mdash;entirely different from
the irregular ridges and spurs of the foothills.</p>

<p>"You're a funny little foothill," he murmured,
"way off by yourself. You look lonesome.
Maybe you're lost, too&mdash;in the big, white Lillimuit."</p>

<p>Waseche returned with the wood and lighted
the fire while Connie tossed the last of the fish
to the dogs. Supper was finished in silence, the
fire replenished, and the two partners lay back on
the robes and watched the little red sparks shower
upward from among the crackling flames.</p>

<p>"We ain't the first that's camped heah,"
remarked Waseche, between noisy puffs at his
pipe. "Yondeh in the thicket is stubs wheah
fiahwood's be'n chopped&mdash;an' one place wheah
consid'able poles has be'n cut. The axe mawks
is weatheh-checked, showin' they was cut green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
But it wasn't done this yeah&mdash;an' me'be not
last."</p>

<p>"I wonder who it was? And what became of
them? What did they want with poles?"</p>

<p>"Built a <i>cache</i>, me'be&mdash;mout of be'n a sled&mdash;but
mo'n likely a <i>cache</i>. We'll projec' around a
bit in the mo'nin'. Me'be we c'n find out who
they was, an' wheah they was headin'. Me'be
they'll be a trail map to some <i>cache</i> befo' this or
to the divide."</p>

<p>"I hope we will find a <i>cache</i>. Then we wouldn't
have to kill a dog."</p>

<p>Waseche's brow puckered judicially:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we would. Yo' see, son, it's like this:
We got mo' dawgs than is needful fo' a two-man
outfit. If we was down to six dawgs, or even
seven, an' one sled, an' they was weak or stahvin,
then we could bust a fish <i>cache</i>&mdash;but to feed twenty-one
dawgs&mdash;that ain't right. Likewise with ouah
own grub&mdash;a man's supposed to take from anotheh
man's <i>cache</i> jest so much as is needful fo' life;
that is, what will get him to the neahest camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&mdash;not
an ounce mo'. This is the unwritten law of
the Nawth. An' a good law. Men's lives is
staked on a <i>cache</i>&mdash;an' that's why when, onct in a
while, a man's caught robbin' a <i>cache</i>&mdash;takin' mo'n
what's needful fo' life, they ain't much time
wasted. He gets&mdash;what's comin' to him."</p>

<p>The dogs had licked up the last crumbs of
their scant ration and, burrowing into the snow,
wrapped themselves snugly in their thick,
bushy tails. Old Boris and Slasher dug their
beds in the side of the mound near where Connie
had spread his robes. The boy watched them
idly as they threw the hard, dry snow behind
them in volleys, and long after the other dogs
had curled up for the night, the sound of old
Boris' claws rasping at the flinty snow could be
heard at the fireside.</p>

<p>"Boris is digging <i>some bed</i>!" exclaimed the boy,
as he glanced toward the tunnel from which
emerged spurts of sand-like snow.</p>

<p>"He ain't diggin' no bed," answered Waseche.
"He smells somethin'." Even as he spoke the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
snow ceased to fly, and seemingly from the depths
of the earth, came the sound of a muffled bark.
Instantly Slasher was on his feet growling and
snarling into the tunnel from which the voice of
old Boris could be heard in a perfect bedlam of
barking.</p>

<p>"Oh! It's a cave! A cave!" cried Connie,
pushing aside the growling wolf-dog. "Maybe
it's the <i>cache</i>!"</p>

<p>Waseche Bill finished twisting a spruce twig
torch. He shook his head dubiously:</p>

<p>"Come heah, Boris!" he called, sharply, "come
out of that!" The old dog appeared, barking joyously
over his discovery. Waseche Bill lighted his
torch at the fire, and pushing it before him, wriggled
into the opening. After what, to the waiting boy,
seemed an age, the man's head appeared at the entrance,
and he pulled himself clear.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired the impatient boy.
"What did you find?"</p>

<p>The man regarded him gravely for a moment,
and then answered, speaking slowly:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 587px;">
<img src="images/i-p149.jpg" width="587" height="660" alt="Waseche Bill attacked the hard-packed snow with his axe." title="Waseche Bill attacked the hard-packed snow with his axe." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Waseche Bill attacked the hard-packed snow with his axe.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"It's an <i>igloo</i>, son&mdash;an <i>igloo</i> buried in the snow.
An' the'h's a man in the'h."</p>

<p>"A <i>man</i>!" cried the astonished boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, kid&mdash;it's Carlson. He's <i>dead</i>."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Tired as they were after a hard day on the
trail, the two partners were unwilling to sleep
without first making a thorough examination of
the buried <i>igloo</i>. More firewood was cut, and
by the light of the leaping flames Waseche Bill
attacked the hard-packed snow with his axe,
while Connie busied himself in removing the cakes
and loose snow from the excavation. At the end
of an hour a squared passageway was completed
and the two entered the <i>igloo</i>.</p>

<p>"He had a plenty grub, anyways," remarked
Waseche, as he cast an appraising eye over the
various bags of provisions piled upon the snow
floor. "He didn't stahve, an' it wasn't the red
death (smallpox)&mdash;I looked pa'tic'lah, fo' I went
out of heah."</p>

<p>Connie glanced at the body which lay partially
covered by a pile of robes. The man's features
were calm and composed&mdash;one could have fancied
him asleep, had it not been for the marble whiteness
of the skin. One by one, they examined all
the dead man's effects; the little Yukon stove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
half filled with ashes, the bags of provisions,
his "war-bag"&mdash;all were carefully scrutinized,
but not a map&mdash;not even a pencil mark rewarded
their search.</p>

<p>"He's met up with Eskimos, somewhe'h,"
said Waseche, examining a rudely shaped copper
pan in which a bit of wicking made from frayed
canvas protruded from a quantity of frozen
blubber grease.</p>

<p>Finally the two turned to the body. The
coarse woollen shirt was open at the throat,
and about the man's neck, they noticed for the
first time, was a thin caribou skin thong. Cutting
the thong Waseche removed from beneath
the shirt a flat pouch of oiled canvas. Connie
lighted the wick in the copper pan and together
the two sat upon a robe and, in the guttering
flare of the smoky lamp, carefully unwrapped the
canvas cover. The packet contained only a
battered pocket notebook, upon whose worn
leaves appeared a few rough sketches and many
penciled words.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yo' read it, kid. I ain't no hand to read
much," said Waseche, handing the book to
Connie, and his eyes glowed with admiration as
the boy read glibly from the tattered pages.</p>

<p>"Tu'n to the last page an' wo'k back," suggested
Waseche.</p>

<p>"January tenth&mdash;" began Connie. "Why, that
was nearly a year ago! He couldn't have been
dead a year!" His eyes rested on the white face
of Carlson.</p>

<p>"A yeah, or a hund'ed yeahs&mdash;it's all the same.
He's froze solid as stone, an' he'll stay like that
till the end of time," replied the man, gravely.</p>

<p>"It says," continued the boy, "'Growing
weaker. For two days no fire. Too weak.
Pain gone, but cannot breathe. To-day'&mdash;That's
all, it ends there."</p>

<p>"Noomony," laconically remarked Waseche.
The preceding pages were devoted almost entirely
to a record of the progress of the disease. The
first notation was January third. Under the
date of January fifth he wrote:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid my time has come. If so, tell
Pete Mateese the claims are staked on Ignatook&mdash;mine
and his. See map in lining of <i>parka</i>. Maybe
Pete is dead. He has been gone a year. He tried
to go out by the Tatonduk. I can't find him. I
can't find the divide. The Lillimuit has got me!
They said it would&mdash;but the gold! It is here&mdash;gold,
gold, gold&mdash;yellow gold&mdash;and it is all mine&mdash;mine
and Pete Mateese's. But the steam! The
stillness! The white, frozen forest&mdash;and the
creeks that don't freeze! After Pete left <i>things</i>
came in the night. It is cold&mdash;yet my brain is on
fire! I can't sleep!"</p>

<p>This proved to be the longest entry; the man
seemed to grow rapidly weaker. When the boy
finished Waseche Bill shuddered.</p>

<p>"The Lillimuit got him," he said slowly.
"He went <i>marihuana</i>." On the next page, under
the date of January sixth, the boy read:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;We&#39;ah lost, kid. It&#39;s a cinch we cain&#39;t
find the divide.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"Made a <i>cache</i> here in timber. Growing
weaker. Tomorrow I will turn back. Mapped
the back trail. <i>2 caches</i>&mdash;then the claims on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Ignatook, the creek of the stinking steam. I will
go out by the Kandik. I mapped that trail. It
is shorter, but I must find Pete Mateese. I must
tell him&mdash;the
claims."</p>

<p>"Who is Pete Mateese? And where is Ignatook?" inquired the boy.</p>

<p>"Sea'ch me!" exclaimed Waseche. "I ain't neveh hea'd tell of eitheh one,
an' I be'n in Alaska goin' on fo'teen yeah."</p>



<p>For an hour they studied Carlson's map, which they found as he had
directed, concealed in the lining of his <i>parka</i>. Finally Waseche Bill
looked up:</p>

<p>"We'ah lost, kid. It's a cinch we cain't find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the divide if Carlson couldn't&mdash;he know'd the
country. The thing fo' us to do is to follow
Carlson's map to his camp, an' then on out by the
Kandik. Neah's I c'n make out, it means about
three or fo' hund'ed miles of trail&mdash;but we got to
tackle it. Tomorrow we'll rest an' hunt up the
<i>cache</i>&mdash;Carlson's past needin' it now. We sho'
got hea'h jest in time!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class ="tdc">ON THE DEAD MAN'S LONELY TRAIL</p>


<p>Connie Morgan pushed aside the flap of his
sleeping bag and blinked sleepily into the blue-gray
Arctic dawn. Far to the north-west, the thin
rays of the belated winter sun pinked the edges
of the ice god's chiselled peaks where the great
white range guarded grimly the secrets of the
man-feared Lillimuit.</p>

<p>The boy closed his eyes and pressed his face
close against the warm fleece. Was it all a dream,
he wondered vaguely&mdash;the crashing wall of the
canyon&mdash;the trail of the white death&mdash;the blazing
aurora&mdash;the search for the Tatonduk pass&mdash;the
buried <i>igloo</i>, and the man who died? Were these
things real? Or, was he still following the trail of
Waseche Bill, with the unknown Lillimuit before
him, and the men of Eagle behind?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Again his eyes opened and he chuckled aloud as
he thought of the man called Joe, and Fiddle Face,
and big Jim Sontag, and the others in the hotel at
Eagle. It was not a dream. There, by the fire,
was Waseche, the coffeepot was boiling with a
low bubbly sound, and beyond was the round-topped
<i>igloo</i>, its white side scarred by the sled-blocked
entrance to the tunnel.</p>

<p>"What's so funny?" grinned Waseche as, frying
pan in hand, he turned at the sound of the boy's
laughter. "This heah mess we ah into ain't no
joke, fah's I c'n see. Whateveh yo' laughin' at,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>The boy wriggled from his sleeping bag and
joined the man by the fireside, where the preparation
of breakfast was well under way.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;I was just wondering what they
thought, next morning&mdash;the men back in Eagle,
who wouldn't let me come to you."</p>

<p>"Me'be it w'd be'n betteh if yo' hadn't of,"
answered the man, with a glance toward the
towering snow peaks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it <i>wouldn't</i>!" flashed the boy; "and, you
bet, it would take more than just saying so to
hold me back! You know you're glad I came&mdash;Anyway,
I <i>did</i> come, and I'd rather be <i>lost</i> here, with
you, than own the best claim on Ten Bow, and go
it alone. You and I are going to beat the Lillimuit,
pardner, and even Carlson couldn't do that!"</p>

<p>"No, he couldn't," agreed the man, eyeing the
boy proudly. "An' theh's plenty othehs, too,
that's tried it. Some come back&mdash;but, mostly,
they didn't. Carlson, in theh&mdash;he was a <i>man</i>&mdash;he
died huntin' up his pahdneh. I wondeh how
much of a strike they made oveh on this heah
Ignatook?"</p>

<p>"It must be something <i>big</i>. The notebook said
there was lots and lots of gold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeh&mdash;an' it said they was creeks that don't
freeze&mdash;an' frozen fohests&mdash;an' things that come
in the night&mdash;an' steam. Yo' see, kid, Carlson
was too long alone. It's boun' to get a man&mdash;the
big, white country is&mdash;if he stays too long from
his kind. It gets 'em with its flashin', hissin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
lights, an' the roah of shiftin' ice&mdash;but, most of
all, with its silence&mdash;the dead, awful stillness of
the land of frozen things. It gets 'em in heah"&mdash;he
pointed significantly to his forehead. "Somethin'
goes wrong, sometimes all of a sudden&mdash;sometimes
gradual&mdash;but, it's all the same&mdash;they might
betteh died.</p>

<p>"But, come on, let's eat, an' then hunt up Carlson's
<i>cache</i>. I sho' hope he was all theah when he
made that map, 'cause, if he wasn't, yo' an' me
is in fo' a hahd winteh. Rampsin' th'ough the
Lillimuit followin' a crazy man's map ain't no
Sunday school picnic&mdash;not what yo' c'n notice&mdash;an'
when we-all come to the end of the trail, we'll
know we be'n somewheahs."</p>

<p>The <i>cache</i> was easily located near the centre
of the thicket. It was a rude crotch and pole
affair, elevated beyond reach of prowling animals.
A couple of blows from Waseche's axe brought the
structure crashing into the snow, and they proceeded
to cut the lashings of the caribou skins
that served as tarpaulins.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Theah's meat a plenty wheah he come from.
Look at them quahte's of caribou, an' the hides."</p>

<p>"He didn't need to go to so much trouble with
his <i>cache</i>. There is nothing here to bother it."</p>

<p>"How about the foxes&mdash;an' wolves, too? Wheah
theah's caribou theah's wolves. An' how about
his dawgs?"</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed Connie. "I wonder
what became of the dogs? And where is his
sled?"</p>

<p>"Sled's undeh the snow, somewheahs&mdash;dawgs,
too, me'be&mdash;'less they pulled out. It's owin' to
what kind they was. <i>Malamutes</i> would of tu'ned
wolf, an' when they found they couldn't bust the
<i>cache</i>, they'd of hit out fo' the caribou heahd.
Hudson Bays an' Mackenzie Riveh dawgs w'd
done sim'lah, only they'd stahved to death tryin'
it. An' mongrels, they'd of jest humped up an'
died wheah they happen' to be standin'."</p>

<p>In addition to several saddles of caribou venison,
the <i>cache</i> contained coffee, flour, salt, a small bottle
of saccharin, and three bags of fish for the dogs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Bound securely to the coffee bag was a rough map
of the trail to the preceding <i>cache</i>, which Carlson
had numbered 2, and they lost no time in comparing
it with the notebook which Connie produced
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"He wasn't plumb loco, anyhow," remarked
Waseche, with a deep breath of relief. "His
maps checks up all right, an' a crazy man couldn't
make two maps hit out the same to save him, I
don't reckon. Anyhow, I'm glad we found this
otheh one. Neah's I c'n make out, it's three
days to the next <i>cache</i>, an' me'be the'll be anotheh
map to check up with."</p>

<p>The remainder of the forenoon was spent in
packing the supplies to the camp, and at noon the
two made a prodigious dinner of fresh caribou
venison, thawed out and broiled over the smokeless
larch coals.</p>

<p>"The dawgs is ga'nted up some consid'ble,
s'pose we jest feed twict today. They be'n on
half ration since we-all left the canyon. 'Tain't
good policy to feed <i>malamutes</i> twict, an' if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
don't hit it out right to the next <i>cache</i>, we'll wisht
we hadn't, but, somehow, findin' that last map
kind of clinched it with me. Whad'yo say,
pahdneh?"</p>

<p>Connie glanced at the brutes lying about in the
snow apparently uninterested in the saddles of
venison and bags of fish piled near the camp fire.
Only Mutt, the huge mongrel "wheel dog" of
Connie's own team, whimpered and sniffed at the
newly found food, for Mutt lacked the stoicism
of the native dogs of the North, who knew that
feed time was hours away. The boy regarded
them with judicious eye and pondered his partner's
proposition gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, we might try it, just this once. They <i>do</i>
look a little gaunt and ribby," and the boy smiled
broadly as he broke out a bag of fish; for the same
thought had been in his own mind for an hour
and he had been just on the point of broaching it
to Waseche, at the risk of being thought a chicken-hearted
<i>chechako</i>.</p>

<p>Connie returned to the fire as the dogs gnawed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and snarled at their unexpected meal. There was
plenty of coffee, now, and while the boy tossed the
grounds onto the snow and refilled the pot,
Waseche Bill whittled a pipe of tobacco, and
stretched lazily upon his robe in the warmth of the
crackling flames.</p>

<p>"We-all must bury him decent," he began, with
a nod toward the <i>igloo</i>, as they sipped at the black
coffee. "An' we must remembeh that name, Pete
Mateese, the man he was huntin' fo'. If he's
alive, he'd like to know. He was his pa'dneh, I
reckon. Seems like, from what the book says,
he neveh know'd about the strike." The man's
eyes roved for a moment over the distant peaks,
and he continued: "It's too bad we cain't dig
no reg'lar grave fo' him, but it would take a good
week to thaw out the ground, an' them fish ain't
goin' to hold out only to the next <i>cache</i>. But I
know anotheh way that's good, heah. The rock
wall yondeh shades the <i>igloo</i> so it won't neveh
melt; leastwise, it ain't apt to. Las' summeh's
sun neveh fazed it 'cept to sog it down all the mo'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
solid. We'll give him a coffin of ice, an' his <i>igloo</i>
fo' a tomb of snow. I'd a heap sooneh have it
that-a-way than like them ol' king of Egyp's,
that's buried in the stone pyramids out on the
aidge of the desert, somewheahs. I seen one,
onct, in the dime museum in Chicago. Ferry
O'Tolliveh, his name was, I recollect, an' the man
that run the place give a consid'able lecture about
him. Seems like he was embalmed, they call
it, which means he was spiced an' all wrapped up
in, I think he said it was a mile an' three-quahtehs
of bandages, anyhow, they was a raft of 'em,
'cause I counted mo'n a hund'ed layehs of cloth
wheah they'd cut th'ough to get to his face.
Which it must of be'n a heap of wo'k without
they put him in a lathe; anyways, theah he was,
afteh bein' dead mo'n two thousan' yeahs!</p>

<p>"The man said how the embalmin' of them ol'
Egyp' undehtakehs is a lost aht, an' I reckon,
afteh takin' a look at Mr. Ferry O'Tolliveh,
fo'ks is glad it is. He looked like the bottom row
of a kit of herring. The man said his mummy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was theah, too, but I didn't stop fo' to look at her&mdash;I
seen all I wanted of the O'Tollivehs from
lookin' at Ferry, but him bein' the only king I
eveh seen, I'm glad I done it, even if he hadn't
kep' well.</p>

<p>"Now, with Carlson, heah, it will be diffe'nt.
He'll be jest the same two thousan' yeahs from
now as he is today, an' was the day he died.
Ice is ice, an' if it don't melt it'll stay ice till the
crack of doom."</p>

<p>The two set about the work with a will. The
provisions were carried outside, the dead man's
effects ranged about the base of the circular wall,
and his robes spread in the centre of the igloo
upon the hard-packed floor of snow. The body
was wrapped in its blankets and laid upon the
robes, and Connie Morgan and Waseche Bill
gazed for the last time upon the face of Carlson,
the intrepid man of the North who, like hundreds
of others, lured by the call of gold, braved the
unknown terrors of the silent land to pass for ever
from the haunts of man. There was that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
strong, clean-cut features of the bearded face to
make them pause. Here was a <i>man</i>! A man who,
in the very strength and force of him, pushed
beyond the barriers, defied the frozen desert,
and from her ice-locked bosom tore the secret
of the great white wilderness; and then, in the
bigness of his heart, turned his back upon the goal
of his heart's desire and faced death calmly in
vain search for his absent partner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/i-p166.jpg" width="660" height="258" alt="The boy's lips moved in prayer, the only one he had ever learned." title="The boy&#39;s lips moved in prayer, the only one he had ever learned." />
<span class="caption">&quot;The boy&#39;s lips moved in prayer, the only one he had ever learned.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Instinctively, the small boy removed his cap
and dropped to his knees beside the dead man,
and opposite him, awkwardly, reverently, with
bared head, knelt Waseche Bill. The boy's
lips moved and in the cold, dead gloom of the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<i>igloo</i>, his voice rang high and thin in the words
of the only prayer he had ever learned:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Now I lay me down to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I pray the Lord my soul to keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If I should die before I wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br /></span>

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Amen."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Amen," repeated Waseche Bill huskily, and
together they left the <i>igloo</i>.</p>

<p>Blocks were cut from the surface of the hard
crusted snow and packed closely about the body.
Snow was melted at the fire and the blocks soaked
with water, which froze almost instantly, cementing
the whole into a solid mass of opaque ice.
In the same manner, the <i>igloo</i> was sealed, and
the body of Carlson was protected both from the
fangs of prowling beasts and the ravages of time.
From the trunk of a young spruce, Waseche Bill
fashioned a rude cross, into which Connie burned
deep the name:</p>

<p class="tdc">
SVEN CARLSON<br />
DIED JAN. 10-19&mdash;.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The cross was planted firmly and, having completed
the task to their satisfaction, the two ate
supper in silence and sought their sleeping bags.</p>

<p>Dogs were harnessed next morning by the little
light of the stars, and long before the first faint
streak of the late winter dawn greyed the north-east,
the outfit swung onto the trail&mdash;the year-old
trail of Carlson, the man who found gold.</p>

<p>Before passing from sight around a point of the
spruce thicket, they halted the sleds for a last
look at the solitary <i>igloo</i>. There, in the shifting
glow of the paling aurora, the little cross stood
out sharp and black against its unending background
of dead white snow, and below it showed
the rounded outline of the low mound that was
the fitting sepulchre of this man of the North.</p>
<div class="p6" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">IN THE HEART OF THE SILENT LAND</p>


<p>Waseche Bill and his little partner followed
blindly the directions upon Carlson's map, which
led them across snow as trackless and unscarred
as the day it fell.</p>

<p>"Fr. C 3 N 3d. to FLAT MT. C 2 on rock-ledge
at flagpole," read the directions on the
map found in the <i>cache</i>, which was the exact
reverse of the directions in the notebook which
read: "Fr. FLAT MT. C 2. S 3d. to C 3. in spruce
grove at <i>igloo</i>." The man had carefully mapped
his trail as he proceeded, and then reversed the
notes for the benefit of any chance backtrailer.</p>

<p>So far, the trail of Carlson was but a projection
of their own trail in search of the Tatonduk
divide, and for two days they mushed steadily
northward, skirting the great range that lay to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
westward. To the north-east and east, as far as
the eye could reach, stretched vast level snow
barrens, and to the southward rolled the low-lying
foothills toward the glacier-studded range which
was still visible, its jagged peaks flashing blue-white
in the distance. Hour after hour they
threaded in and out among the foothills, avoiding
the deeper ravines, and with tail rope and gee
pole working the outfit across coulees.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the third day, both Connie
and Waseche scanned the range eagerly for a
glimpse of the flat mountain, but the early winter
darkness settled about them without the sight of
a mountain that could, by any stretch of imagination,
be called "flat."</p>

<p>"Prob'ly we-all ah mushin' sloweh than what he
done," ventured Waseche, as he peered into the
gloom from the top of a rounded hill. "I hate to
camp, an' I hate to mush on an' pass the landmahk
in the dahk. It's mo' or less guesswo'k,
followin' a cold trail. Landmahks change some,
an' even if they don't, the time of yeah makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
diffe'nce, an' then, things looks diffe'nt to one
man from what they look to anotheh. Likewise,
things looks diffe'nt nights, than daytimes. Of
co'se, a flat mountain couldn't hahdly look like
nothin' else but a flat mountain nohow, but yo'
cain't tell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure we haven't passed it," interrupted
the boy.</p>

<p>"No, we ain't <i>passed</i> it. What's pestehin'
me is, did Carlson know whetheh he mushed three
days or ten? An' whetheh he c'd tell a flat
mountain from a peaked one? I've saw fog
hang so that eveh' mountain yo' seen looked
flat&mdash;cut right squah acrost in the middle."</p>

<p>"Let's mush on for a couple of hours. There is
light enough to see the mountains, and we might
as well be lost one place as another." The man
grinned at the philosophical suggestion.</p>

<p>"All right, kid. Keep yo' eyes peeled, an'
when yo' get enough jest yelp an' we 'll camp."</p>

<p>Hour after hour they pushed northward among
the little hills. The sled runners slipped smoothly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
over the hard, dry snow, and overhead a million
stars glittered in cold brilliance against the blue-black
pall of the night sky. And in all the vast
solitude of the great white world the only living
things were the fur-clad man and boy and the
shaggy-coated dogs that drew the sleds steadily
northward. Gradually it grew lighter and the
stars paled before the increasing glow of the
aurora. Broad banners flashed and waned in
the heavens, and thin streamers of changing lights
writhed and twisted sinuously, illuminating the
drear landscape with a dull, uncanny light in
which objects appeared strangely distorted and
unreal.</p>

<p>Was it possible that other eyes had looked
upon these cold, dead mountains? That other
feet had trodden the snows of this forsaken world-waste?
It seemed to the tired boy that they had
passed the uttermost reach of men, and gazed
for the first time upon a new and lifeless land.</p>

<p>They eased out of a ravine on a long slant, and
at the top Connie halted McDougall's <i>malamutes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and waited for Waseche Bill, whose sled had nosed
deep into the soft snow of a huge drift. The man
wrenched it free and urged on his dogs, which
humped to the pull and clawed their way to the
top, sending little showers of flinty snow rustling
into the ravine. As the boy started the big ten-team,
the light grew suddenly brighter. The
whole North seemed bathed in a weird, greenish
glow. Directly before him a broad banner
flashed and blazed, and in the bright flare of light,
upon the very edge of the vast frozen plain,
loomed a great white mountain whose top seemed
sheared by a single stroke of a giant sword!
The boy's heart leaped with joy.</p>

<p>"The flat mountain! It's here! It's here!"
he cried, and up over the rim of the ravine rushed
Waseche Bill, and in silence they gazed upon the
welcome sight until the light disappeared in a
final blaze of glory&mdash;and it was night.</p>

<p><i>Cache</i> number two was easily located upon a
shelf of rock before which a wind-whipped piece of
cloth fluttered dejectedly at the top of a sapling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
firmly embedded in the snow. In spite of the
increased confidence in Carlson's map, it was
not without some trepidation that the partners
set out the following day upon the second lap of
the dead man's lonely trail.</p>

<p>"Fr. FLAT MT. C 2. DUE E 4d C 1 STONE
CAIRN RT. BANK FORK OF RIV. FOL. RIV.
N-E." were the directions upon the trail map
pinned with a sliver to a caribou haunch. It
had been well enough to skirt the great mountain
range beyond which, to the westward, lay Alaska.
It was quite another thing, however, to turn their
backs upon this range and strike due east across
the vast snow-covered plain which stretched,
far as the eye could reach, as level as the surface of
a frozen sea. For four days they must mush eastward
across this white expanse, without so much
as a hill or a thicket to guide&mdash;must hold, by
compass alone, a course so true that it would
bring them, at the end of four days, to a certain
solitary rock cairn at the fork of an unnamed river.
Even the hardened old <i>tillicum</i>, Waseche Bill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hesitated as the dogs stood harnessed, awaiting
the word of command, and glanced questioningly
into the upturned face of the small boy:</p>

<p>"It's a long shot, son, what do yo' say?" His
answer was the thin whine of the boy's long-lashed
dog whip that ended in a vicious crack at
the ears of McDougall's leaders:</p>

<p>"Mush-u, mush-u, hi!" and the boy whirled
the long ten-team away from the mountains,
straight into the heart of the Lillimuit.</p>

<p>The crust of the snow that lay deep over the
frozen muskeg and tundra was ideal for sled-travel
and, of course, rendered unnecessary the use
of snowshoes. All day long the steel-blue, cold
fog hung in the north, obliterating the line of the
flat horizon. The bitter wind that whipped and
tore out of the Arctic died down at nightfall and,
for the first time in their lives, the two felt the
awful depression of the real Arctic silence. Mountain
men, these, used to the mighty uproar of
frost-tortured nature. The silence they knew
was punctuated by the long crash of snow cornices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
as they tore loose from mountain crags and
plunged into deep valleys to the roar of a riven
forest; by the sudden boom of exploding trees;
and the wild bellowing of lake ice, split from shore
to wooded shore in the mighty grip of the frost
king.</p>

<p>But here, on the frozen muskeg, was no sound&mdash;only
the dead, unearthly silence that pressed upon
them like an all-pervading <i>thing</i>. Closer and
closer it pressed, until their lungs breathed, not
air&mdash;but <i>silence</i>&mdash;the dreaded, surcharged silence
of the void&mdash;the uncanny silence that has caused
strong men to leap, screaming and shrieking, upon
it and, bare-handed, seek to wring its awful secrets
from its heart&mdash;and then to fall back upon the
snow and maunder and laugh at the blood stains
where the claw-like nails have bitten deep into
their palms&mdash;but they feel no pain and gloat
foolishly&mdash;for to their poor, tortured brains this
blood is the heart's blood of the Silence of the
North.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the ground rose slightly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the low level of the muskeg. All day they traversed
long, low hills&mdash;which were not hills at all,
but the roll of the barren ground, and in the
evening came upon the bank of the river, but
whether above or below the fork they could not
tell.</p>

<p>"We'll follow it down&mdash;nawthwahd&mdash;fo' that's
what the map says, an' if we do miss the <i>cache</i>,
we'll strike the Ignatook camp in two mo' days.
We got grub enough if a stawm don't hit us. I
sho' am glad we-all didn't get catched out yondeh."
The man's eyes swept the wide expanse of barrens
that lay between them and the distant peaks.
"It's a good hund'ed an' fifty mile acrost them
flats&mdash;we sho' was lucky!"</p>

<p>The ice-locked river upon which they found
themselves was a stream of considerable size
which flowed north, with a decided trend to the
eastward. The muskeg and tundra had given
place to the rocky formation of the barren lands
which cropped out upon the banks of the river
in rock reefs and ledges. Scrub trees and bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in sickly patches fringed the banks, their leafless
branches rattling in the wind.</p>

<p>An hour's travel on the snow-covered ice of the
river brought them to a sharp bend where a river
flowed in from the eastward, and there, almost
at the confluence of the two streams, stood the
solitary rock cairn, a monument some seven feet
in height and five feet in diameter at its base.</p>

<p>"He didn't <i>cache</i> no great sight of meat heah,"
observed Waseche as, one by one, they removed
the stones of the cairn. "We got a plenty, but
I counted on this fo' the dawgs." Even as he
spoke, they came upon a flat stone midway of the
pile, which required their combined strength to
displace. With a harsh, grating sound it slid
sidewise into the snow, disclosing a considerable
cavity, in the centre of which lay, not the expected
<i>cache</i> of caribou meat, but a human skull, whose
fleshless jaws grinned into their startled faces in
sardonic mockery. Beside the skull lay a leaf
torn from Carlson's notebook, and in Carlson's
handwriting the words:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>FOL. RIV. 2d N to CREEK OF STEAM.
FOL. UP CREEK 2m. CAMP W BANK IN
OLD MINE TUNNEL. DISCOVERY 100ft.
E. TUNNEL MOUTH. 1 ABOVE CLAIM&mdash;STAKED
FOR PETE MATEESE. LOOK
OUT FOR WHITE INJUNS.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Ol' mine tunnel! White Injuns!" exclaimed
Waseche. "I tell yo' what, son: so fah, Carlson's
maps has hit out, but when he begins writin'
about white Injuns an' ol' mine tunnels, an'
<i>cachin'</i> skull bones, 'stead of meat! It's jest as
I tol' yo'! We-all got to keep on now, but I
sho' wisht we'd neveh found Carlson an' his
crazy maps."</p>

<p>"Whose skull do you suppose it is? And why
did he <i>cache</i> it, I wonder?" asked Connie, as he
handled gingerly the gruesome object.</p>

<p>"Seahch me!" said the man, glancing at the
weather blackened skull. "Come on, le's mush."</p>

<p>As they advanced the surface of the surrounding
land became more broken and the river descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
rapidly in a series of falls, enclosed by the freezing
spray, in huge irregular masses of green-hued ice,
which impeded their progress and taxed to the
utmost the skill of the drivers and the tricks of the
trail-wise dogs in preventing the sleds from being
dashed to pieces upon the slope of the ice domes,
from whose hollow interiors came the muffled
roar of the plunging falls.</p>

<p>The dogs were again on half ration, and even
this was a serious drain upon the supply of meat.
The walls of the river became higher until, on the
second day, they were threading a veritable
canyon. At noon the light dimmed suddenly,
and the two gazed in surprise at the sun which
glowed with a sickly, vapoury glare, while all about
them the air was filled with tiny glittering frost
flakes, which lay thick and fluffy under their feet
and collected in diamond flashing clusters on the
rocks and bushes of the canyon walls.</p>

<p>"It's snowing!" cried Connie, excitedly.
"Snowing at forty below!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't snow, son. It's frozen fog, an' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
cain't sense it. I c'n see how it might thick up
an' snow, even at forty below, but fog! Doggone
it! It takes wahm weatheh to <i>make</i> fog&mdash;<i>an'
it ain't wahm!</i>"</p>

<p>Toggling the lead dogs, they selected a spot
where the wall of the canyon was riven by the
deep gash of a small feeder and climbed laboriously
to the top for a better view of the puzzling
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Scarcely a quarter of a mile ahead a great bank
of fog ascended, rolling and twisting toward the
heavens. Slowly it rose from out of the snow,
spreading into the motionless air like a giant
mushroom of glittering diamond points which
danced merrily earthward, converting the whole
landscape into a mystic tinsel world. Far to
the westward the bank extended, winding and
twisting like some great living monster.</p>

<p>"It's the creek of the steam!" cried Waseche
Bill. "It's theah wheah Carlson's camp is."
But, so entranced was the boy with the weird
beauty of the scene, that he scarcely heard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
He pointed excitedly toward a low hill whose
sides were wooded with the scrub timber of the
country, where each stunted tree, each limb
and spiney leaf curved gracefully under its weight
of flashing rime. Towers, battlements, and spires
glinted in the brilliant splendour, for, out of the
direct line of the fog bank that hung above the
course of the narrow creek, the sun shone as clear
and bright as the low-hung winter sun of the
sub-Arctic ever does shine, and its slanting rays
flashed sharply from a billion tiny facets.</p>

<p>"It's the frozen forest that he wrote about!"
exclaimed the delighted boy. "It's the most
beautiful thing in the world! Now, aren't you
glad you came?" But Waseche Bill shook his
head dubiously, and began the descent to the
canyon.</p>

<p>"Why! Where are the dogs!" cried the boy,
who was first upon the surface of the river.
Waseche hurried to his side; sure enough, neither
dogs nor sleds were in sight and the man leaped
forward to examine the thick carpet of rime.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

spoke, a grotesquely feathered, beaver-topped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
head appeared above a frost-coated rock, almost
at his elbow, and the two partners stared open-mouthed

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">O'BRIEN</p>


<p>Surprise held Connie Morgan and Waseche Bill
spellbound as they stood ankle-deep in the glittering
frost spicules that carpeted the surface of
the ice-locked river, and gazed speechless into the
face that stared at them over the top of the rime-crusted
rock.</p>

<p>The spell broke. From behind other rocks
appeared other faces surmounted by odd beaver-skin
caps, edged with the feathers of the blue, and
snow goose, and of the great white Arctic owl.
The partners glanced from one to the other
of these strange, silent faces that regarded them
through wide-set, in-slanting eyes. The faces
were white&mdash;or rather, through the winter's
accumulation of grease and blubber soot, they
showed a light brownish yellow that, in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with the faces of other Indians, would easily pass
for white. And they were so nearly alike that a
stranger would have been at his wits' end to have
distinguished one from another&mdash;all except the
first one, the man whose face appeared so suddenly
almost at Waseche Bill's side. He was taller
than the others, his nose longer and thinner, and his
whole lower face was concealed behind a luxurious
growth of flaming red whiskers, while through
the soot and grease his skin showed ruddy, rather
than yellow, and his small, deep-set eyes were of a
peculiar greenish hue.</p>

<p>"Japs an' Irish!" exclaimed Waseche Bill.
"Carlson was right&mdash;even to his frozen fohest an'
white Injuns!"</p>

<p>He addressed the company with a comprehensive
wave of his arm:</p>

<p>"Good evenin', gents. How they comin'?"</p>

<p>His words were greeted with stony-faced stares
as meaningless and void of expression as the
stare of a frozen fish. Waseche tried again:</p>

<p>"It's a right smaht spell o' weatheh we're havin',<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
ain't it? An' how's all the folks? Don't all talk
to onct, now, till I get through welcomin' yo' into
me an' the kid's midst&mdash;oah else tellin' yo'
how glad we-all ah to find ouhselves amongst yo'&mdash;owin'
to who's givin' the pahty." He glanced
from face to face, but, as before, all were stolid
as graven images. Suddenly he turned upon the
bewhiskered one of the green eyes:</p>

<p>"Hey, yo' red chinchilly! Cain't yo' talk none?
An' cain't yo' yelleh perils, heah, ondehstand no
language? I cain't talk no laundry, myself, but
besides American, I'm some fluent in Chinook,
Metlakat', Tlinkit, an' Athapascan. As fo' yo',
yo' look to me like the Tipperary section of a
Patrick's Day parade! Come on, now&mdash;loosen
up! If yo' an' Injun, so'm I&mdash;only I've done
moulted my feathehs, an' washed my face since
the Fo'th of July!"</p>

<p>Directly addressed, the man stepped from behind
his rock, and the lid of the left green eye
dropped in a decided wink. The others immediately
followed, crowding close about the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>comers.
Squat, full-bodied men, they were,
fur-clad from top to toe, and all armed with short,
copper-tipped harpoons which they leaned upon
as they stared. Waseche grinned into their wide,
flat faces, as he of the red whiskers elbowed to the
fore and spoke in a singsong voice with a decided
Hibernian accent:</p>

<p>"Which me name's O'Brien," he began, "an'
ut's both sorry an' glad Oi am to see ye. But,
phwere's th' shtampede?" He glanced anxiously
up the river.</p>

<p>"What stampede?" asked Waseche, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Phy, th' shtampede! Th' shtampede to th'
Ignatook, th' creek yondher&mdash;th' creek that biles."</p>

<p>"Sea'ch me! Me an' the kid's all theah is&mdash;an'
yo' wouldn't hahdly call us a stampede."</p>

<p>"But, Car-rlson! An' th' breed, Pete Mateese!
Didn't they nayther wan git t'rough? Ilse,
how'd ye come to be follyin' th' back thrail?"
The man's anxiety increased, and he waited
impatiently for an answer.</p>

<p>"No. Carlson didn't get through. We come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
onto his last camp about ten days back. He died
huntin' the Tatonduk divide. But, how come
yo'-all to be heah? Who's yo' friends? An'
wheah's ouh outfit?"</p>

<p>"Hivin hilp th' bunch av us!" wailed the
Irishman. "No shtampede, afther all&mdash;an' we'll
all be dead befoor we live to git out av this!"
The man gazed far out into the gathering gloom,
wringing his hands and muttering to himself.
Suddenly his eyes lighted, and he questioned the
two eagerly:</p>

<p>"D'yez know about Flor-ridy?" he asked,
"phwere they say a man kin be war-rum? An'
how man-ny quar-rts av nuggits w'd ut take f'r
th' car-r-fare, an' to buy, me'be ut's a bit av a
tobaccy shtor-re on th' sunny soide av th' shtrate,
wid a bit av a gar-rdin behint, an' a pig in his pin
in th' yar-rud?</p>

<p>"An', shpykin' av tobaccy, hav' yez a bit to
shpare? Ut's niver a shmoke Oi've had in goin'
on six year&mdash;an' kin ye lind me th' loan av a
match?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Waseche tossed the man his tobacco and eyed
him sharply as he lighted the short, black cutty
pipe that he produced from a pocket of his thick
caribou-hide shirt.</p>

<p>"They've took th' outfit to th' village,"
O'Brien said. "But, about Flor-ridy, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll talk that oveh lateh. Let's be mushin',
I don't want them sleds too fah in th' lead."</p>

<p>"Sur-re, they'll not be far-r. 'Tis ondly ar-round
th' bind av th' r-river." He spoke a few
harsh, guttural syllables to one of the fur-clad
men, who wore across his shoulders the skin of a
beautiful black fox.</p>

<p>"'Tis a foine language, ain't ut? An' to think
Oi've hur-rd no other f'r six years past!"</p>

<p>"What do yo' call it?" asked Waseche, as they
followed in the wake of the natives, who had
started northward at the Irishman's words.</p>

<p>"Call ut! How sh'uld Oi know? Oi c'd be
ar-rested in an-ny town in Oirland f'r phwat Oi've
called ut! But, Oi've got used to ut, now&mdash;same
as th' raw fish, an' blubber. How man-ny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cans av nuggits did ye say? Wan quar-rt tomatty
cans, wid a rid label, haypin' full&mdash;an' is ut raylly
hot in Flor-ridy, or ondly middlin' war-rum, loike
Kildare in th' summer?"</p>

<p>"Florida's hot," ventured Connie. "I learned
about it in school. And there's oranges, and
alligators that eat you when you go in swimming."</p>

<p>"Shwimmin'! Sur-re, Oi ain't bin shwimmin'
in, Oi don't know phwin. Phy, Oi ain't seen me
<i>hide</i> in six years!"</p>

<p>They proceeded a short distance, with O'Brien
muttering and chuckling in the rear, and upon
rounding a sharp bend, came in sight of the
village, a group of some fifteen or twenty snow
<i>igloos</i>, situated upon a plateau or terrace overlooking
the river. In front of an <i>igloo</i> somewhat
larger than the others, stood the dog-teams with
their loaded sleds surrounded by a crowd of
figures that differed in no single particular from
the dozen or so who mushed along in advance.
Old Boris, Mutt, and Slasher, the three unharnessed
dogs that had accompanied Connie and Waseche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to the top of the high plateau from which they had
obtained the view of the creek of the steam and
the white forest, now trotted close to the heels of
the boy.</p>

<p>"I don't quite like the looks of things, kid,"
whispered Waseche, as they approached the trail
that slanted upward to the village. "O'Brien's
touched a little in his uppeh stohy, but he may be
smaht enough in some things. He ain't wild-eyed,
an' me'be he'll be all right now. I reckon
he's jest be'n thinkin' of them wahm countries till
he's a bit off. We got to keep ouh eyes peeled an'
get out of this heah fix the best way we can.
Me'be the Irishman'll help, an' me'be he'll hindeh.
These heah Jap-faced Injuns don't appeah to be
much hostyle, an' we betteh lay low an' get the
hang of things fo' a couple of days befo' we go
makin' any break."</p>

<p>"We'll take <i>him</i> with us," said Connie. "Just
think of a white man living up here for six years!"</p>

<p>"We sho' will!" agreed Waseche. "I hope
them heathens ain't cleaned out Carlson's camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Raw fish an' blubber don't sound good to me&mdash;theah's
some things a man don't <i>want</i> to get use'
to. Heah we ah; we got to hold ouh nehve, an'
keep ouh eyes open."</p>

<p>"How man-ny cans av nuggits did ye say?"
interrupted O'Brien, as he overtook them at the
rise of the trail. "They're heavy."</p>

<p>"Why, they're all men!" exclaimed Connie, as
they reached the spot where the entire village
stood grouped about the sleds.</p>

<p>"Indade, an' they ain't!" refuted O'Brien.
"They's fifty-seven av um all towld, incloodin'
mesilf, an' th' half av us is wimmin&mdash;ondly ye
can't tell th' difference nayther in looks nor-r
dhress. An' a homlier-r, mor-re ill-favour-red
crew niver wuz let be born, bein', near-r as Oi
kin figger, half Injun, half Eskimo, an' half Chinee&mdash;an'
they'll ate an-nything they kin chaw!"</p>

<p>At the approach of the white men, the Indians
drew back, forming a wide circle about the dog-teams.
Into this circle stepped a very old man,
who leaned heavily upon the shaft of his harpoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and blinked his watery, red-rimmed eyes. From
the corners of his mouth long tufts of white hair
grew downward until they extended below the
angle of his jaw. These tufts, stiff with grease,
gleamed whitely like the ivory tusks of a walrus.
With a palsied arm he motioned to O'Brien, who
stepped before him and spoke rapidly for several
moments in the guttural jargon he had used on the
river. The old man answered and, as he talked,
his tongue clicked oddly against his teeth, which
were worn to the level of his gums.</p>

<p>"What ails grandpa?" asked Waseche, when the
old man had finished. "Was he sayin' somethin,'
oah jest exehcisin' his mouth?"</p>

<p>"Sur-re, that's Metlutak, the owld chayfe;
he's give over his job mostly to Annunduk,
yondher, wid th' black fox shawl, but on mathers
av impoortance th' owld wan has his say."</p>

<p>"I didn't get the drift of his ahgument&mdash;I neveh
leahnt no blue jay."</p>

<p>"He says," began O'Brien, with a broad grin,
"he says ye're welcome into the thribe. He'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
set th' young min buildin' an <i>igloo</i>, an' he's glad
ye've got so man-ny dogs f'r 'tis two moons
befoor th' caribou move, an' th' fresh mayte will
tasht good afther a winther av fish an' blubber."</p>

<p>"Meat!" exclaimed Connie, with flashing eyes.
"Does he think he's going to eat those dogs?"</p>

<p>"Ye don't see no dogs in th' village, do yez?
An' nayther they ain't bin excipt th' six they shtole
off Car-rlson an' Pete Mateese&mdash;an' they was
into th' bilin' pot befoor they quit kickin'."</p>

<p>"Well, you can tell him he don't get any of these
dogs to eat! And if any one lays a hand on a dog,
I'll&mdash;I'll knock his block off!"</p>

<p>"Now, hold on, son," cautioned Waseche Bill,
with his hand upon the boy's shoulder. "We
got to kind of take it easy. This heah ain't no
time fo' an uprisin' of the whites&mdash;the odds ain't
right." He turned to the Irishman:</p>

<p>"O'Brien, yo' want to get out of this heah
country, don't yo'?"</p>

<p>"Sur-re, an' Oi do!" eagerly exclaimed the man.
"But, ut's six years Oi've throied ut, an' nar-ry a
wanst hav' Oi done ut. Av ye kin make ut, Oi'm
wid yez&mdash;but, av we don't save th' dogs, we'll
niver do ut. They're good thrailers, th' punkin
faced ejits, an' they've br-rung me back twinty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>-wan
toimes, be th' clock. Car-rlson an' Pete
Mateese had dogs, an' they got away."</p>

<p>"We-all can make it! Don't yo' worry none.
I be'n in tight fixes befo'. Jest yo' listen to me,
an' stall the ol' boy off fo' a day oah two. That'll
give us a chanst to make medicine." O'Brien
turned to the old walrus-faced shaman and there
followed a half-hour of lively conversation, at
the end of which the man reported to Waseche:</p>

<p>"They're gr-reat hands f'r to hav' dances, ut's
par-rt av their haythen religion&mdash;that is, they
call um dances, an' ut shtar-rts in that way&mdash;but
ut woinds up loike a Donnybrook fair. 'Tis
gr-rand fun&mdash;wid har-rpoon shafts cr-rackin'
down on heads loike quarther-staves; f'r barrin'
pick handles, wan av thim har-rpoons is th' besht
club, nixt to a black thor-rn shelala, f'r a foight
amongst frinds, an-ny day in th' wake.</p>

<p>"Oi towld um th' dogs wuz skin-poor fr-rom
th' long thrail, an' not fit f'r to ate, but a couple
av days wid plinty av fish in their bellies, would
fat um up loike a young seal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"'We'll have a big <i>potlatch</i>,' says he. 'We've
more fish thin we nayde. Feed up th' dogs,'
says he, 'an' in two shlapes, we'll hav' th' biggest
<i>potlatch</i> in th' histhry av th' thribe. We'll dance
all night, f'r Oi'm gittin' owld,' says he, 'an' ut
may be me lasht.' Oi hope so, thinks Oi, but Oi
don't say so. An-nyhow, we kin resht airy f'r a
couple av days an' th' dogs'll be safe an' well
fed. 'Twud be all a man's loife wuz wor-rth to
har-rm wan till th' owld man gives th' wor-rd.
Ye said ut wuz raylly hot in Flor-ridy, b'y? Hot
enough, d'ye think, that a felly c'd set ar-round
in his shir'rt shlaves, an' shmoke a bit av an
avenin'?"</p>

<p>O'Brien offered to share his <i>igloo</i> with Connie
and Waseche Bill, but they declined with thanks
after one look into the smoky interior that fairly
reeked with the stench of rancid blubber and raw
skin bedding.</p>

<p>Hardly had the dogs been unharnessed before
four Indians appeared with huge armfuls of frozen
fish, and while the gaunt <i>malamutes</i> gnawed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
ravenously at the food, the whole village looked on,
men and women licking their chops in anticipation
of the coming <i>potlatch</i>, pointing out the choicest
of the dogs, and gesticulating and jabbering over
the division of the spoils.</p>

<p>The light shelter tent, robes, and sleeping bags
were removed from the sleds, and O'Brien offered
to help.</p>

<p>"Set ut up clost ag'in' th' <i>igloo</i>," he said, "an'
Oi'll tunnel a hole t'rough th' soide, an' tonight we
kin lay an' plot loike Fenians, an' th' ar-risthocracy
here'll think we're sound ashlape dhreamin' av
<i>malamute</i> mulligan, an' dog's liver fried in ile."</p>

<p>The tent was quickly set up and Connie was
about to loosen the lashings of the grub pack.</p>

<p>"How much grub hav' ye got?" asked the
Irishman.</p>

<p>"We got a right smaht of grub, except fo' th'
dawgs," answered Waseche.</p>

<p>"Don't uncover ut, thin," warned O'Brien.
"Jist tilt yer tarp a bit an' pull out enough f'r
th' suppher. They won't bother-r th' outfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
none&mdash;th' owld man towld um to lave hands off
an' they'd divide the whole shebang afther th'
dance."</p>

<p>"Yo' don't say," drawled Waseche. "Grandpa's
a generous heahted ol' pahty, ain't he!
D'yo' reckon we-all w'd be in on th' divvy, oah
do we jest furnish the outfit?"</p>

<p>O'Brien grinned:</p>

<p>"Ye'd fare same as th' rist," he said. "Sharre
an' shar-re aloike is th' rule here. Sur-re, they're
socialists&mdash;ondly they don't know ut."</p>

<p>"Yo' say they won't let yo' get away from
heah? What do they want of yo'&mdash;an' what do
they want of us? Afteh they've et the dawgs an'
divided the outfit, looks like they'd be glad to
get rid of us."</p>

<p>O'Brien filled his pipe and noisily blew great
clouds of smoke into the air:</p>

<p>"'Tis a thing Oi've niver found out. Six years
Oi've bin hilt pr-risoner. They've thrayted me
same as theirsilves. Oi do no mor-re wor-rk
thin an-ny man av thim, an' av they're glutted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
wid grub so'm Oi, an' av they're hungr-ry, Oi'm
hungr-ry, too. Near-r as Oi kin make out
Oi'm jist a kapesake&mdash;loike ye're grandfayther's
swor-rd, or a canary."</p>

<p>"How did Carlson an' Pete Mateese get away?"</p>

<p>"Sur-re, they niver wuz caught! They got
to the Ignatook; that's phwat these haythen call
th' creek av th' bilin' wather&mdash;an' they fear-r
ut. Niver a man av thim will go into ut's valley.
They say ut's divil-ha'nted. Th' wather's black
an' bilin'&mdash;an' ut stinks. Ut's pizen, too; av ye
dhrink ut ye'll die. They's a pile av bones, an'
man-ny a skull ar-round th' owld copper mine.
'Twuz wan av thim Oi shlipped into th' rock
cairn, back yondher, hopin' to warn th' fur-rst
av th' shtampede to wait f'r th' rist, phwin th'
Injuns robbed th' <i>cache</i>.</p>

<p>"Av we kin git to th' Ignatook wid th' dogs,
we're safe. Oi've hid there a dozen toimes, but Oi
niver c'd make th' outside f'r lack av dogs. They's
sixteen hunder' pounds av caribou mate in th'
tunnel, an' sixty percers av fish.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"They've an eye on us, an' Oi'm fear-red they'll
misthrust we're plottin'. Wait till tonight, an'
Oi'll go now an' make up a fairy shtor-ry that'll
satisfy th' owld chayfe about our long palaver-r."</p>

<p>O'Brien started toward the old shaman, but
turned and retraced his steps:</p>

<p>"How man-ny quar-rts av nuggits did ye say?"
he asked, as a far-away look crept into his eyes.
Waseche Bill answered softly:</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know what nuggets is fetchin'
a quaht. But, offhand, I'd say a quaht oah two
w'd be a plenty to take yo' clean around the
wohld."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE ESCAPE FROM THE WHITE INDIANS</p>


<p>The man, O'Brien, despite the fact that he
spent half his time mooning and muttering to
himself about quarts of gold and the delights of a
torrid clime, proved himself no mean strategist,
and his intimate knowledge of the lay of the land
and the habits and language of the natives, was
invaluable in formulating the plan of escape.</p>

<p>Far into the night the three lay, Connie and
Waseche Bill in their sleeping bags under the
little shelter tent pitched close against the rounded
side of the <i>igloo</i>, and O'Brien lying inside the <i>igloo</i>
upon his vile-smelling bed of skins with his face
to the hole he had bored low in the snow wall.</p>

<p>Their only hope in getting out of the Lillimuit
lay in saving the dogs, and it was decided that this
could be accomplished only by a quick dash for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the Ignatook, which joined the larger river a
quarter of a mile to the northward.</p>

<p>On the sleds remained about five hundred pounds
of caribou venison, besides a small quantity of
tea, coffee, bacon, and flour.</p>

<p>"Ut's loike this," concluded O'Brien, when the
situation had been carefully reviewed from every
slant and angle, "Oi'll go to owld Metlutak, tomorry,
an' Oi'll say: 'Chayfe,' Oi'll say, 'thim
dogs is a plinty soight ribbier thin phwat Oi
thought they wuz. We can't git no fat onto um
insoide av a wake or tin days but we kin hav'
th' <i>potlatch</i> jist th' same&mdash;ondly we'll hav' <i>two
potlatchs</i> instead av th' wan. They is foive
hunder' pounds av caribou mate on th' sleds an'
we'll hav' th' caribou <i>potlatch</i> fur-rust, an' th' dog
<i>potlatch</i> lather, phwin they've bin give a chanst to
lay on some fat.'</p>

<p>"Th' owld b'y won't loike th' caribou so much
as th' dog but Oi'll pint out to um that av we
use th' caribou fur-rust th' dogs can't shlip along
in th' noight an' ate it up on us, whoilst av we kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
th' dogs an' lave th' caribou, ye can't tell phwat
w'd happin."</p>

<p>"But the dogs couldn't eat the meat if they were
dead!" objected Connie.</p>

<p>"Whisht lad! Th' chayfe don't know no
'rithmetic. Two <i>potlatches</i> is bether thin wan, an'
beyant that he ain't goin' to study.</p>

<p>"We'll wor-rk ut loike this: they's about tin
pound av mate apiece&mdash;no gr-reat glut&mdash;but
enough to kape um busy afther th' dance. Th'
dance'll begin phwin th' sun jist edges yondher
peaks, an' wanst they git het to the wor-rk, 'twill
kape up till mid-noight. We'll dhrag th' mate
over, an' Bill, here, he'll shtand ridy wid his axe
to cut ut in chunks, an' Oi'll toss ut to wan an'
another so they'll all git a piece. They'll ghrab ut
an' dhrive their har-rpoons into ut so they kin
howld ut over th' foir-re an' thaw ut out. They'll
ate ut raw off th' ind av th' har-rpoons&mdash;'tis a
gr-rand soight!</p>

<p>"Now, her-re's phwere th' b'y comes in: as soon
as Bill shtar-rts choppin' mate, ye must shlip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
over here an' har-rness th' dogs f'r all ye're worth.
Ye must finish befoor th' mate's all doled out.
Hav' th' loight grub an' th' robes an' shlapin'
bags on th' sleds, but lave th' tint shtand. Lave
th' roifles in th' pack; they've niver kilt me, an'
Oi won't see har-rm come to thim&mdash;but av Oi
c'd git a good cr-rack at wan or two wid me fisht,
'tw'd aise th' mimry av thim, twinty-wan toimes
they've dhrug me back over th' tundra.</p>

<p>"Wanst their har-rpoons gits dhrove into th'
fr-rozen mate, they'll niver git um out till they're
thawed out. They'll be too heavy to run wid, an'
be th' toime they kin fr-ree thim, we'll be safe on
th' Ignatook, phwere they wudn't come afther us
av they doied fur-rst.</p>

<p>"We kin take our own toime gittin' to th'
outsoide. They's plinty av grub in th' tunnel&mdash;an'
plinty av gold, too&mdash;all put away in tomatty
cans; an' they're heavy&mdash;foorty pound apiece
they weigh, av they weigh an ounce&mdash;an' that's
wan rayson they've tur-med me back thim
twinty-wan toimes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far-r did ye say ut wuz to Flor-ridy,
afther ye cr-ross th' muskeg?"</p>

<p>"I reckon it's quite a spell, O'Brien," answered
Waseche. "But yo' c'n bet yo' last blue one, me an'
th' kid'll see yo' git theah&mdash;an' don't yo' fo'get it!"</p>

<p>Darkness&mdash;not the black darkness of the States,
but the long twilight of the early Arctic night&mdash;descended
upon the Lillimuit. Upon the narrow
plateau overlooking the unnamed river, squat
fur-clad figures emerged from the tunnel-like
entrances of the <i>igloos</i> and, harpoon in hand,
moved slowly through the gloom toward a circular
level of hard-packed snow immediately in front of
the house of the chief, where other figures were
busily heaping brushwood and frozen pieces of
drift upon a fire that smoked and smouldered in the
centre of the area.</p>

<p>At the edge of the circle, Waseche Bill, Connie
Morgan, and O'Brien sat upon the haunches of
venison and watched the strange men and women
take their places about the fire where they ranged
themselves in two circles, one within the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and waited in stolid silence for the appearance of
the two chiefs.</p>

<p>Presently they approached, carrying queer
shaped drums which consisted of a narrow frame
or hoop of split willow about two feet in diameter.
Upon these frames were stretched the thin, tough
membranes that form the abdominal lining of the
seal. A handle of carved walrus ivory was affixed
to the hoop with lashings of sealskin. The chiefs
carried no harpoons, and as each took his place, the
old chief in the inner circle, and the young chief
in the outer, they raised their drums and struck
sharply upon the edges of the rims with their
short ivory drumsticks. The sound produced
was a resonant, rather musical note, and at the
signal the circles moved, the inner from right to
left, the outer from left to right. Slowly, at
first, they moved to the measured beat of the
drums. The scene was weird and impressive,
with the strange, silent people circling in the
firelight whose red flare now and then illumined
their flat grease-glistening faces. The drums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
beat faster and between the beats could be heard
the husk of the <i>mukluks</i> as they scraped upon the
hard surface of the snow.</p>

<p>Gloom deepened into darkness and still they
danced. Suddenly out of the north flashed a
broad band of light&mdash;mystic illusive light writhing
and twisting&mdash;now bright&mdash;now dim. Rose flashed
into amethyst and vivid scarlet into purple and
pale yellow colouring the whole white world with
its reflected light.</p>

<p>Instantly the scene changed. Faster and faster
beat the drums; faster and faster circled the
dancers, and suddenly from every throat burst
the strange words of a weird, unearthly chant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Eerie and impressive the sight, and eerie the
rise and fall of the chant with which the
children of the frozen wastes greet the Aurora&mdash;the
flashing, hissing warning of the great Tuaña,
the bad man, who lies dead at the end of the
earth.</p>

<p>The words ceased, the drums struck into a
measured, monotonous, pom, pom, pom, and the
dancers continued to circle about the fire. A man
separated himself from the others and, stepping
into the fire-lit circle, began to chant of his deeds
of valour in the hunt, of his endurance on the
trail, and his fortitude in accident and famine.
As he chanted he danced, swaying and contorting
his body, and then, either his tale was told, or he
became weary and dropped back into the circle
and gave place to another. Hour after hour
the white men watched the strange incantations,
moving about at intervals to keep warm. The
endurance of the natives was a source of wonder
to Connie and Waseche Bill. They had been
continuously at it for nine hours, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
midnight when O'Brien reached swiftly over and
touched Connie upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Look aloive, now, b'y! The owld chayfe is
th-radin' his dhrum f'r a har-rpoon, an 'tis th' sign
f'r th' <i>potlatch</i>!"</p>

<p>Sure enough! With amazing suddenness the
circles broke up and the dancers made a concerted
rush for the caribou meat. Connie slipped unnoticed
into the shadows and ran for the sleds,
while Waseche Bill swung his ax and O'Brien
distributed the chunks to the crowding Indians.</p>

<p>As soon as one received his portion he placed it
upon the snow and drove his harpoon in past the
barbs to prevent its being jerked off in the wild
scramble for a place at the fire. As O'Brien had
said, the orgy that started as a religious ceremony
was winding up like a Donnybrook fair, for the
natives fought and pummelled each other with spear
and fist in their efforts to thaw out their meat.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour all were served and
not a shred remained that was not firmly transfixed
upon the point of a harpoon. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Indians still fought by the fire, but some of the
more fortunate had retreated to a distance and
were gnawing and tearing at the raw chunks,
using the harpoons in the manner of a huge fork.</p>

<p>"Now's our chanst!" whispered O'Brien; and
with an eye upon those who were eating, they
dodged swiftly behind the chief's <i>igloo</i>.</p>

<p>When Connie reached the shelter tent he fell
immediately to work harnessing the dogs which he
roused from their snug beds in a huge snowdrift.
At first his fingers trembled with excitement so
that he fumbled clumsily at the straps, but he
soon regained his nerve and, one after another, the
<i>malamutes</i> were fastened into their proper places.
He slipped the collar on to McDougall's gaunt
leader and waited, tense with anxiety, listening
and peering into the darkness for sound or sight
of his two companions.</p>

<p>After what seemed hours of suspense, he saw
them approaching at a run, and sprang to his
place, his fingers gripping tightly the handle of
his dog whip.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same instant, the boy became aware
that the scene at the fireside had changed. In
the uncertain light of the flaring flames he had
been able to make out an indistinct blur of fighting
figures accompanied by a jumble of growls and
short, animal-like yelps, as the natives pushed and
pummelled each other for a place by the coveted
fire. As the figures of Waseche and O'Brien drew
closer, the yelps and growls gave place to loud
cries, the fighting ceased, and in the dim light
Connie made out other running figures, and still
others standing upon their chunks of meat and
wrenching frantically to free their harpoons.</p>

<p>The next instant Waseche Bill leaped to his
dogs and O'Brien threw himself upon Connie's
waiting sled.</p>

<p>"Let 'em go, kid!" cried Waseche, and the
sharp crack of the dog whips rang on the air to
the cries of: "Mush! Hi! Hi! Mush-u!
Mush-u!"</p>

<p>Both teams shot away toward the inclined
trail of the river. Neck and neck, they ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
over the crusted snow, while the three free dogs
romped and raced beside them.</p>

<p>While most of the Indians followed directly
in the wake of the retreating men, a few of the
wiser ones cut straight for the head of the trail
down which the outfit must pass. Waseche's
eight <i>malamutes</i>, travelling lighter than Connie's
big ten-team, forged to the front and gained the
incline at the same moment that three Indians
led by Annunduk, the young chief, leaped out
upon the trail. The natives, tired by their
long exertions at the dance, had thrown away
their weighted harpoons and, except for a short
club that Annunduk had snatched from a <i>cache</i>
frame as he ran, were unarmed.</p>

<p>Waseche dodged a blow from the club and
an Indian who tried to throw himself upon the
flying sled was hurled from the trail and rolled
end over end down the steep hundred-foot slope
to the river.</p>

<p>A quarter of a minute later McDougall's big
<i>malamutes</i> swung into the trail and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
dashed past the spot before the Indians could
have collected their senses, had not O'Brien,
with Irish impetuosity, leaned far over the side
and aimed a mighty blow of his fist at the head of
Annunduk. The blow swung wide and O'Brien,
losing his balance, pitched headlong into the snow
almost at the Indian's feet.</p>

<p>Connie, whose attention was upon the rushing
dogs, felt the sled leap forward as the man's weight
was removed, and without an instant's hesitation
halted the dogs in their tracks and, clutching his
dog whip, ran to the assistance of O'Brien, who
was clawing and rolling about in the snow in a
vain effort to regain his feet.</p>

<p>There was not a second to lose. By the light
of the stars the boy saw Annunduk leap forward
with club upraised, while the remaining Indian
was making ready to spring upon the defenceless
man from behind. Connie redoubled his efforts
and, just as the chief raised his club for a long
shoulder swing at O'Brien's head, the boy's
fifteen-foot gut lash sang through the thin air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
There was a report like a pistol-shot and, with a
loud yell of pain, Annunduk dropped his club and
clutched frantically at his face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;The boy&#39;s fifteen-foot lash sang through the thin air.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the other Indian had almost reached
the Irishman who had scrambled to his hands and
knees. Connie leaped backward to get the range
of his long whiplash, but before the boy could
draw back his arm, the air roared with a long,
throaty growl and Slasher, the savage wolf-dog,
with back-curled lips and flashing fangs, leaped
past and launched himself full at the throat of
the Indian. With awful impact, the great tawny
brute landed squarely upon the man's chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
carrying him backward into the snow. The
next instant the air was filled with frightened
shrieks and ferocious, full-mouthed snarls as the
wolf-dog tore and wrenched at the heavy skin
shirt, while the terrified Indian protected his face
with his arms.</p>

<p>The whole incident occupied scarcely a minute,
and Connie half-dragged the dazed O'Brien to
his feet and hurried him to the sled. With a loud
whistle to Slasher, the boy cracked his whip above
the ears of the leader and, just as the head of the
trail became black with pursuing Indians, the
<i>malamutes</i> shot away, with Slasher running beside
them, growling fiercely and shaking a great patch
of quill-embroidered shirt front which waved
from his tight-clamped jaws.</p>

<p>Down on the river, Waseche Bill was in the act
of swinging his dogs for a dash over the back trail
when the long ten-team rushed out onto the rime-carpeted
ice. All danger from pursuit was past,
and they jogged the teams slowly northward,
while all about them fell the frost spicules in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
feathery shimmer of tinsel. Ten minutes later
O'Brien pointed out the trail which passed between
two enormous rocks and entered the valley
of the Ignatook, the creek of the stinking steam,
into which the Indians dared not venture. And
it was with a grateful sense of security and relief
that they headed the dogs for the spot where
they were to camp, in the old tunnel of the lost
mine of the Ignatook&mdash;at the end of the dead
man's lonely trail.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class ="tdc">O'BRIEN'S CANS OF GOLD</p>


<p>When Connie Morgan and Waseche Bill awoke,
the morning after their midnight escape from
the village of the strange Indians, they found
O'Brien busily engaged in the preparation of
breakfast.</p>

<p>The tunnel of the ancient mine, that had been
the abode of Carlson and Pete Mateese, was
merely a rude entry which followed the slant of
an outcropping mass of native copper. The
entry was approximately five feet high and six
feet wide, and led obliquely into the face of a
rock-cliff for a distance of a hundred feet where it
widened into a chamber, or room, perhaps twenty
feet in diameter and seven or eight feet in height.
Three walls of the room were formed by the
copper ore which showed plainly the marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the primitive tools of the forgotten miners. The
fourth wall was of solid rock&mdash;the wall of the
fissure that contained the vein of ore. At the
angle formed by the roof and the rock wall, a wide
crack, or cleavage cleft, slanted sharply upward
and outward to a point on the face of the rock-cliff
high above the mouth of the tunnel, and thus
formed a natural chimney for the rude fireplace
that had been built directly beneath it.</p>

<p>The odour of boiling coffee was in the air and
by the fireplace squatted O'Brien, prodding tentatively
at the caribou steaks that sizzled noisily
in the long-handled frying pan. Upon a flat
stone that had evidently served for a table, an
ancient lamp which consisted of a rudely hammered
copper pan containing blubber grease and
a bit of moss wicking, flared its smoky illumination.</p>

<p>"Good marnin' to yez," greeted the Irishman,
as the two partners slipped from their sleeping
bags and drew up close to the fire. "Sure,
bhreakfasht'll be riddy in wan minit&mdash;an' a good
job ut is, to be settin' wanst mor-re amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Christians, an' aytin' whoite man's grub, inshtead
av suckin' a shtrip av blubber, along av th'
flat-faced Injuns, yondher."</p>

<p>Connie laughed:</p>

<p>"Yes, but you nearly spilled the beans when
you tumbled off the sled."</p>

<p>"Ahroo! Dar-rlint! Ut's a gr-rand lad ye
ar-re! Ye shud av seen um!" he cried, turning to
Waseche Bill. "Oi wanted to git jist th' wan
swoipe f'r um to remimber me by, but Oi mished
um fair an' square, an' over Oi wint loike a frog
off a log in a bog. An' jist phwin Annunduk
wuz about to presint his soide av th' case wid a
bit av a club th' heft av a pick handle, crack!
goes th' b'y's whiplash fair in th' face av um,
an' phwin th' other goes to jump on me back,
Whirra! They's a roar loike th' Zoo tur-rned
loose f'r recess, an' th' wolf-dog's a-top av um,
fang an' claw! Ye shud av seen ut! 'Twuz a
gr-rand soight!"</p>

<p>Waseche smiled proudly as he listened to the
Irishman's account of the accident on the trail.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yo' say, they won't follow us in heah?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Niver a wan av thim. They think this valley is
th' counthry av th' evil spirits. We're safe now&mdash;an'
hooray, f'r Flor-ridy, an' th' land av sunshine!"</p>

<p>"We-all ain't out of the woods yet. I'm sho'
glad to be shet of them Injuns, though. How
many times did yo' say they'd brung yo' back?"</p>

<p>"Twinty-wan toimes. But, Oi hadn't no dogs&mdash;an'
thim two tomatty cans is heavy!"</p>

<p>"Where are the cans?" asked Connie, who had
only half believed the Irishman's tale of gold.</p>

<p>"Set by now an' ate, an' Oi'll show ye thim&mdash;the
two av moine, an' th' twilve av Car-rlson's an'
Pete Mateese's."</p>

<p>The meal over, O'Brien loosened a cleverly
concealed wedge that held in place a stone which
served as a door to a small compartment, about
eighteen inches square and three feet deep, that
had been chiselled into the copper on a level with
the floor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis th' safe," he grinned. "Foire proof, an'
bhurglar proof, too, av ye don't know th' combynation,
fer wid th' little wedge in place, th'
more ye pryze on th' rock th' toighter ut shticks."</p>

<p>Pushing the stone aside, the man reached into
the interior and, one at a time, removed fourteen
tin cans, which he carefully deposited upon the
floor. Over the top of each, serving as a cover,
and concealing the contents from view, was
bound a piece of caribou skin, smoke-dried, with
the hair on.</p>

<p>Connie reached for a can, but to his surprise
it remained motionless as if nailed to the floor.
It seemed incredible to the boy that such great
weight could be encompassed within so small a
space, and it was only at the expense of considerable
effort that he succeeded in raising it to his
lap. Cutting the thongs, he removed the cover
and there, showing yellow and dull in the guttering
flare of the blubber lamp, was gold! O'Brien
spread an empty pack-sack and the boy poured
the contents of the can upon it, and with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
fingers levelled the golden pyramid. Before him
lay nuggets, flat, dark flakes of "float," and
bright yellow grains of "dust"&mdash;hand-shovelled,
and hand-sluiced from the hot, wet sands of the
Ignatook. Waseche Bill stared speechless at the
row of skin-covered cans, at the pile of yellow
metal, and back to the row of cans. For years
this man had toiled and mucked among the
placers of the gold fields, had sunk deep shafts,
and shallow; had tunnelled, and drifted, and
sloshed about in ice-cold muddy creek beds,
but in all the years of toil and hardship and peril,
he had never gazed upon a sight like this. Even
Ten Bow, with its rich drift sands, was a barren
desert in comparison with this El Dorado of the
frozen waste.</p>

<p>"Nine thousan' dollahs a can&mdash;mebbe ten,"
he estimated, in an awed voice. "No wondeh
Carlson came back!" He turned to O'Brien:</p>

<p>"How deep was his shafts?"</p>

<p>"Shafts!" exclaimed the Irishman, "sure, they
ain't no shafts! Ye dam off a puddle av wather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
phwer uts shallow an' throw in a chunk av oice
to cool ut, an' thin ye wade in an' shovel ut into
ye're sluices."</p>

<p>"An' wateh the yeah around!" cried Waseche.</p>

<p>"Aye, an' no dumps to wor-rk out in th' shpring&mdash;ye
clane up as ye go. Wan shovel is good f'r a
can, or a can an' a half a month."</p>

<p>The idea of a man measuring his dust by the
forty-pound can, instead of by the ounce, was
new, and Waseche Bill laughed&mdash;a short, nervous
laugh of excitement.</p>

<p>"Come on! Shove them cans back in the hole
an' le's go stake ouh claims. Yo' done stoke
yo'n, ain't yo', O'Brien?"</p>

<p>"Oi've shtaked nawthin'! Oi jist scooped ut
out here an' there, phwere their claims wasn't. Oi
want none av this counthry! Oi've had enough av
ut as ut is! Oi won't shtay wan minit longer thin

an' live loike a civiloized Christian shud live, wid
a pig an' a cow, an' a bit av a gar-rden.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye'll not be thinkin' av shtayin' here?" he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, O'Brien," answered Waseche, "not <i>this</i>
trip. But we ah goin' to stake ouh claims an'
then, lateh, why me an' th' kid heah&mdash;we ah comin'
back!"</p>

<p>"Come back av ye want to," said O'Brien with
a shrug. "But luk out ye don't come back
wanst too often. Phwere's Car-rlson, an' Pete
Mateese? Thim's min that come back! An'
wait till ye see th' skulls an' the bones along th'
gravel at th' edge av th' wather&mdash;thim wuz
min, too, wanst&mdash;they come back. An' luk
at <i>me</i>! Four av us come in be way av Peel River&mdash;an'
three av us is dead&mdash;an' many's th' toime
Oi've wisht Oi wuz wan av thim." O'Brien
replaced the stone, and the three turned their
attention to their surroundings. One side of the
room was piled to the ceiling with the caribou
venison and fish of which O'Brien had spoken.
They also found a sled and a complete set of harness
for a six-dog team&mdash;Carlson's six dogs that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
found their way into the boiling pots of the White
Indians. Scattered about the stone floor lay
numerous curiously shaped stone and copper
implements, evidently the mining tools of a
primitive race of people, and among these Connie
also found ancient weapons of ivory and bone.</p>

<p>Slowly they made their way toward the entrance,
pausing now and then to examine the rough walls
of the tunnel which had been laboriously driven
through the mass of copper ore.</p>

<p>"Wonder who worked this mine?" speculated
Connie. "Just think of men working for years
and years, I s'pose, to dig out <i>copper</i>&mdash;with all
that gold lying free in the gravel."</p>

<p>"Yeh, son, seems queeah to us. But when yo'
come to think of it, coppeh's wo'th a heap mo'n
gold, when it comes down to usin' it fo' hammehs,
an' ha'poons, an' dishes. Gold ain't no real
good, nohow&mdash;'cept fo' what it'll buy. An' if
they ain't no place to spend it, a man mout a
heap sight betteh dig out coppeh."</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly on the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
when the three finally stood at the tunnel-mouth
and gazed out into the valley of the Ignatook.
A light wind carried the steam and frozen fog
particles toward the opposite bank, whose high
cliffs appeared from time to time as islands in a
billowy white sea. Almost at their feet the
waters of the creek wound between banks of glittering
snow crystals, and above them the great
bank of frozen mist eddied and rolled. The stakes
Carlson had driven to mark his claim, and that of
Pete Mateese, were plainly visible, and upon the
black gravel at the water's edge were strewn the
weather-darkened bones of many men.</p>

<p>"The copper miners!" cried Connie, pointing
toward the grewsome collection. Waseche nodded.</p>

<p>"I reckon so," he answered. "I wondeh what
ailed 'em."</p>

<p>"Aye, what!" echoed O'Brien. "What but th'
Ignatook&mdash;that's shpelt death to iverywan that's
come into uts valley. Th' whole Lillimuit's a
land av dead min. Av ut ain't th' wan thing,
uts another. Phwere's Car-rlson, an' Pete Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>teese?
Av ye don't dhrink th' pizen wather,
ye'll freeze, er shtar-rve, er ye'll go loike Craik

th' wor-rst av all. Craik, glum an' sombre,

shtraight into th' mid-noight aurora&mdash;an 'nayther

<p>"Ye'd besht moind phwat Oi'm tellin' yez,"
he croaked, as he sat upon the bank and watched
Waseche and Connie stake adjoining claims.</p>

<p>"Ut's th' same in th' ind," he continued,
letting his glance rove over the tragic relics of a
bygone race. "Some comes f'r copper, an' some
f'r gold&mdash;an' phwere's th' good av ut? Th'
metal is left&mdash;but th' bones av th' diggers mark
th' thrail f'r th' nixt that comes! An' none goes
back!"</p>

<p>"We're going back!" said Connie. "You don't
know, maybe Pete Mateese got through."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mebbe he did&mdash;but ut's mebbier he didn't,"
despaired the man.</p>

<p>"Now, look a heah, O'Brien," cut in Waseche,
"yo' be'n up heah so long yo' plumb doleful an'
sad-minded. We-all ah goin' to get out of heah,
like the kid done told yo'. Come on along now
an' stake out yo' claim 'long side of ou'n. I've
mined, it's goin' on fo'teen yeah, now&mdash;an' I neveh
seen no pay streak like this heah&mdash;not even Nome,
with her third beach line; the Klondike, with its
shallow gravel; oah Ten Bow, with its deep yellah
sand. It's no wondeh yo' expected a stampede."</p>

<p>But the Irishman was obdurate and, despite all
persuasion, flatly refused to stake a claim.</p>

<p>"Come on, then," said Waseche. "We-all
got to locate that map of Carlson's. He said
how he mapped the trail to the Kandik."</p>

<p>"Sure, an' he did!" exclaimed O'Brien. "Oi
found th' map six months agone. But ivery
toime Oi'd thry to folly ut, thim danged haythins
ud dhrag me back."</p>

<p>"Where is the map? Le's see it," said Waseche.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
O'Brien stared from one to the other of his companions,
with a foolish, round-eyed stare. Suddenly
he leaped to his feet and without a word
dashed down the creek in the direction of the
river, leaving Waseche and Connie to gaze after
him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where's he going?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Sea'ch me!" exclaimed Waseche; "come on&mdash;we
got to catch him. Me'be he's took a spell.
Po' fellow, I'd hate fo' anything to happen to
him now."</p>

<p>O'Brien had obtained a very considerable
lead when the others started and, giving no heed
to their cries to halt, he lumbered heavily onward.
Connie and Waseche ceased to call and, saving
their breath, dashed after him as fast as their
legs could carry them. The Irishman was in
good muscle and wind, thanks to his life in the
open, but in neither speed nor endurance was he a
match for his pursuers, who were iron-hard from
the long snow trail. When O'Brien neared the
pass that gave out onto the river, the two partners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
redoubled their efforts and, although they gained
perceptibly, O'Brien was still ten yards in advance
when he plunged between the two upstanding
rocks that Connie had named the "gate-posts of
the Ignatook."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;As they passed between the pillared rocks the Indians broke
cover, hurling their copper-tipped harpoons as they ran.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, the boy, who
had outdistanced Waseche, dashed after him
and with a "flying tackle" tripped the fleeing
man, so that both rolled over and over upon the
rime-covered ice of the river. And Waseche
Bill, bursting upon the scene, saw, approaching
silently and swiftly among the rocks and scrub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the river's edge, shadowy, fur-clad forms.
The White Indians were guarding well the
egress from the creek of the frozen steam.</p>

<p>Hastening to the two struggling figures, Waseche
jerked them to their feet, and before the surprised
O'Brien knew what was happening, he was
being unceremoniously hustled into the narrow
valley from which he had just emerged&mdash;and
none too soon, for as they passed between the
pillared rocks, the Indians broke cover and rushed
boldly upon them, hurling their copper-tipped
harpoons as they ran.</p>

<p class ="tdc">FIGHTING THE NORTH</p>


<p>"Wheheveh was yo' aimin' fo' to go to?"
interrogated Waseche, when they were once
more safely seated about the fireplace in the room
at the end of the old mine tunnel.</p>

<p>"Sure, ut's th' map!" answered O'Brien, in a
tone of the deepest dejection.</p>

<p>"The map! What about it?"</p>

<p>"Ut's in me other pants!" wailed the Irishman.
"Back in th' <i>igloo</i>!"</p>

<p>"The <i>igloo</i>! The <i>igloo</i>&mdash;back there?"</p>

<p>"That same," nodded O'Brien, shamefacedly
dropping his glance before the wrathful glare of
Waseche's eyes. "Ye see, ut's loike this: two
years ago, Oi bruk away fr' th' haythins an'
made th' Ignatook. Car-rlson an' Pete Mateese
wuz here thin, an' Oi shtayed wid um f'r a month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
until wan day Oi wuz fishin' in th' river, an' they
shwooped down an' caught me befoor Oi c'd
git back into th' valley. Afther that they
watched me clost, an' befoor Oi c'd git away ag'in
Car-rlson an' Pete Mateese wuz gone. 'Twuz
thin Oi found his map, pegged to a caribou haunch
on top av th' pile yondher, an' Oi shtayed here an'
wor-rked till Oi'd all th' gold Oi c'd pack, an' thin
Oi shtar-rted f'r th' Kandik. They caught me,
av coorse, bekaze th' heft av thim cans, along wid
phwat grub Oi wuz dhraggin' on th' sled, wuz
more thin a wan man load. They're sooperstitious
about th' creek, an' th' gold, too, an' they
slung th' cans back into th' valley.</p>

<p>"That's two toimes Oi got away, an' since
that they ain't watched me so clost, f'r they've
lur-rned that widout dogs, Oi can't make ut to th'
outside&mdash;an' Be Jabbers! nointeen toimes since,
Oi've been dhrug back, but Oi always kep' th'
map f'r fear that sometoime Oi'd git to use ut&mdash;an'
now, phwin we've got th' chanst, Oi've gone
an' murdhered us all be layvin' ut behint&mdash;an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
all on account av th' dance an' th' <i>potlatch</i>, be
rayson av which Oi wint an' changed me britches!"</p>

<p>The man's grief was so genuine, and his dejection
so deep that the wrathful gleam faded from
Waseche Bill's eyes, and Connie moved nearer
and placed his hand upon the Irishman's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Never mind, O'Brien. You didn't mean to
leave the map&mdash;we know that&mdash;don't we,
Waseche?"</p>

<p>"Sho', he didn't," answered the man, gloomily.
"But that don't help the <i>case</i> any. How we-all
ah goin' to get out of heah, now, is mo'n I
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me nayther," assented O'Brien. "Av Oi'd
shtayed in Kildare, Oi w'dn't be here now. We
bether go back an' settle down wid th' Injuns&mdash;av
we c'n make friends wid um ag'in, befoor they
har-rpoon us&mdash;f'r Oi'll niver see Flor-ridy, now!"</p>

<p>Connie leaped to his feet and stood before
the two men, who looked into the narrowing grey
eyes that flashed in the flickering flare of the
blubber lamp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 607px;">
<img src="images/i-p237.jpg" width="607" height="659" alt="&quot;You make me tired!&quot; cried Connie. &quot;Anybody&#39;d think you needed

<span class="caption">&quot;You make me tired!&quot; cried Connie. &quot;Anybody&#39;d think you needed

</div>

<p>"You make me <i>tired</i>!" cried the boy, "both
of you&mdash;with your talk of not getting out of the
Lillimuit; and of going back to the Indians! Why,
they'd eat up our dogs, and then we <i>couldn't</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
get out! What's got into you, Waseche? Buck
up! Anybody'd think you needed a city, with
the streets all numbered, to find your way around!</p>

<p>"Carlson came in by the Tatonduk&mdash;and he
went out by the Kandik&mdash;his first trip, when he
showed the nuggets he brought back. Who
made Carlson's map? He was a sourdough&mdash;but
he has nothing on <i>us</i>! He found his own way
out&mdash;and so will we! If we miss the Kandik,
we'll find a pass of our own&mdash;or a river&mdash;or a
creek! We're not afraid of the Lillimuit. It
hasn't got us yet! And it isn't going to! We've
got the dogs, and we've got the grub&mdash;and we've
got the nerve to back them. We'll hike to the
outside on our own trail&mdash;and we'll turn around
and come back after the gold!</p>

<p>"But, if we don't make it&mdash;and have to die
out there in the White Country&mdash;when they find
us, they'll know <i>men</i> died! We'll be, anyway, <i>one</i>
day's mushing ahead of our last camp fire!"</p>

<p>Waseche leaped to the boy's side and grasped
the small, doubled fist.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"They sho' <i>will</i>, kid!" he cried. "They sho'
<i>will</i>! But they ain't a goin' to find us bushed!
I wisht yo' daddy c'd of heahd yo' then&mdash;He
was <i>some</i> man, Sam Mo'gan was, an' he'd sho' be
proudful of his boy!</p>

<p>"I'm plumb 'shamed, pahdneh, fo' to gloomed
up on yo' that-a-way&mdash;ain't we, O'Brien?"</p>

<p>"We ar-re, that!" shouted the Irishman,
with a new light in his eyes. "Ye're a gr-rand
lad, wid a hear-rt, in ye're ribs, that's th' heart
av a foightin' man. F'r all ye're small soize,
ye're th' gamest wan av th' three av us. An' uts
Pathrick O'Brien'll folly ye to th' top av' th'
narth pole, av ye say th' wor-rd."</p>

<p>A week was spent in exploring the valley of the
Ignatook and in prospect panning at different
points along the mysterious boiling creek whose
hot, black gravel showed an unbelievably rich
pay streak.</p>

<p>O'Brien improved rapidly from day to day.
The despairing, furtive look faded from his eyes,
which glowed with a new hope and a new-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
determination to do a man's part in the accomplishment
of a purpose. His wild dash for the
river showed the utter futility of attempting to
recover Carlson's map, for the loss of which he
blamed himself bitterly. Nevertheless, the words
of the boy put new heart into the lonely man,
who ceased mumbling and muttering of Florida,
and threw himself with a will into the work in
hand.</p>

<p>The high rock-cliffs that flanked the valley
of the Ignatook curved toward the west in two
solid walls, unbroken except at a point two miles
above the old mine, where a narrow ravine led in a
long, winding slope to the level of the surrounding
plateau.</p>

<p>It was by way of this ravine, O'Brien assured
them, Carlson had taken his departure; and that
this fact was known to the White Indians was
clearly demonstrated when, each day they saw
silent fur-clad figures silhouetted against the clearcut
skyline. There was something ominous and
forbidding in the attitude of the silent sentinels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of the frozen wastes who thus guarded the exits
from the valley of the creek-of-the-steam. Time
and again Connie glanced from the immutable
watchers to the blackened bones upon the gravel
at his feet. These were men, once; had they really
drunk the poison water? Or, had they been
held prisoners until they starved, by the human
vultures that gloated in their lonely perches high
among the rim-rocks?</p>

<p>"If you couldn't outguess 'em, why didn't you
rush 'em?" he asked one day, addressing a sightless,
grinning skull. And behind him, O'Brien laughed.</p>

<p>"They won't foind our-rn here, will they,
b'y?"</p>

<p>"You bet they won't!" exclaimed Connie,
and shook a small fist at a solitary, motionless
figure on the brink of the high rock wall.</p>

<p>To the westward of the mouth of the ravine
the walls drew close together, so that the hot
black waters of the creek completely filled the
narrow gorge and effectively blocked any further
ascent of the valley.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like to huht no one, needless," said
Waseche Bill, as they sat about the fireplace one
evening discussing plans for escape; "but we-all
got to get out of heah&mdash;an' we ah <i>goin'</i> to get out
too&mdash;an' if it comes right down to a matteh of
<i>them</i>, oah <i>us</i>, why it's theah own fault if they get
huht."</p>

<p>"Yis," agreed O'Brien, "Oi shpose ye're roight.
But, somehow&mdash;ye see&mdash;they divoided grub wid
me phwin they wuz hungr-ry."</p>

<p>"I know, O'Brien, but that don't give 'em no
right to hold us heah, an' to stahve us an' steal
ouh dawgs, neitheh. We need them dawgs to
get back with&mdash;an' we ah goin' to keep 'em. We-all
cain't stay heah no longeh&mdash;much. 'Cause,
outside of the meat an' fish, we ah runnin' pow'ful
shoht of grub. An', besides, the days is gettin'
longeh mighty fast, an' the trail ahead of us is a
long trail&mdash;even if we have good luck, an' if the
snow softs up on us we cain't haul no load, an'
when it melts we cain't cross no rivehs, an' if we
get to the mountains yondeh, we won't have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ice-trail to get out on. No, seh! We got to get
out of heah&mdash;an' we got to go <i>now</i>&mdash;an' if anyone
tries fo' to stop us, why somethin's goin' to happen&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"They's wan way&mdash;an' ondly wan, that we c'n
me'be give um th' shlip," said O'Brien. "'Tain't
no use thryin' ut in th' dar-rk, f'r th' rayvine
is narrow an' they've a foire at th' head uv ut.
We'll be travellin 'heavy, an' we can't git t'rough
um wid a whoop an' hurrah, loike we done in th'
village&mdash;but we moight shlip by in th' shnow."</p>

<p>"In the snow?" asked Connie. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Sur-re, they's a star-rm brewin'&mdash;th' soigns

or two, an' she'll br-reak, beloike, on th' tur-rn

thim, an' not a nose'll they shtick outsoide till

f'r to be ketched out in ut&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Them, an' me&mdash;both!" interrupted Waseche
Bill.</p>

<p>"Ahroo! Now, come on! Ut's f'r their own
good we're doin' ut. Oi know th' fur-rst fifteen
er me'be ut's twinty moiles av th' thrail to th'
Kandik. We'll wor-rk ut loike this: They know
they's a star-rm comin'&mdash;Oi seen a little knot av

into th' Narth. We'll let um see us fetchin'
wood into th' moine, loike we wuz gittin' ridy to
hole up f'r th' star-rm. Th' sleds we'll load jist
insoide th' mouth av th' tunnel, an' phwin they

shlip up th' rayvine, an' out achrost th' bench.
They's a bit av a mountain out yondher, me'be
ut's tin moiles, an' on th' soide av ut we c'n camp

they've picked up our thrail, we'll be out av their

havin' fear-r av phwat lies beyant."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>O'Brien finished, and Waseche turned to Connie:</p>

<p>"What do yo' say, son?" he asked. "Shall
we try it? It ain't a goin' to be no snap, out
theah on the white bench with the snow an' th'
roahin' wind. It's a funny thing&mdash;this heah
takin' a long chanst jes' to keep a gang of Injuns
from hahmin' us so we won't hahm them."</p>

<p>"They divoided their grub," repeated O'Brien,
with an appealing glance at the boy.</p>

<p>"And, for <i>that</i>, we'll take a chance!" answered
Connie. "We're game."</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the following morning, the
three busied themselves in cutting firewood and
carrying it into the tunnel. Indians appeared
here and there among the rim-rocks and, after
watching for a time, departed in the direction of
the village. By noon, the weather had thickened
perceptibly. A thin grey haze filled the atmosphere
through which the weak rays of the Arctic
sun filtered feebly. There was no wind, and the
air lost its invigorating crispness and clung heavily
about them like a wet garment. No more Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
appeared upon the edges of the cliffs and Waseche
Bill ventured upon a scouting expedition up the
narrow ravine, while Connie and O'Brien remained
behind to pack the sleds and carry an occasional
armful of firewood for the benefit of any lingering
observer.</p>

<p>The boy insisted upon loading Carlson's sled,
carefully fitting the collars to the necks of his
own three dogs, which had been hardly a half-dozen
times in the harness since their memorable
dash through the hills when Connie beat out the
Ten Bow stampede.</p>

<p>Waseche returned reporting a clear trail, and
all fell to harnessing the dogs.</p>

<p>"Whateveh yo' doin' with <i>that</i> sled?" asked
Waseche, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take it along," answered Connie.
"You can't ever tell what will happen, and old
Boris and Mutt and Slasher may as well be working
as running loose."</p>

<p>Waseche grinned:</p>

<p>"Go ahead if yo' want to. Them ol' dawgs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
mout get somewhehs with it, an' if they don't,
yo' c'n cut yo' trace-lines an' tu'n 'em loose."</p>

<p>"<i>Is that so!</i>" flared the boy. "If there's any
cutting loose to be done, you can do it yourself!
<i>This</i> sled goes to Ten Bow! And, what's more,
there isn't a lead dog in the world that can touch
old Boris&mdash;and you know it! And if big Mutt
couldn't out-pull any two of your dogs, he'd be
ashamed to waggle his tail! And Slasher could
lick your whole team&mdash;and Mac's, too! And I
wouldn't trade a flea off any one of my dogs for
your whole string of mangy <i>malamutes</i>&mdash;<i>so there!</i>"</p>

<p>Waseche chuckled with delight as he winked at
O'Brien:</p>

<p>"If yo' eveh want to staht somethin' right
quick," he laughed, "jest yo' go ahead an'
belittle th' kid's dawgs." And then he dodged
swiftly as one of the boy's heavy mittens sailed
past his head and slapped smartly against the
wall.</p>

<p>O'Brien's two cans of gold were removed
from the "safe" and placed, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sleeping-bags, robes and blankets, upon Connie's
sled. The stone was adroitly wedged into place
and arranged so naturally that no marauding
visitor could possibly have guessed that the
innocent-appearing rock concealed a treasure of
upwards of one hundred thousand dollars' worth
of pure gold. The caribou venison and fish,
together with what remained of the outfit, had
already been securely lashed to the larger sleds
and, with a last look of farewell, the little cavalcade
moved from the tunnel-mouth and headed
for the ravine.</p>

<p>All trace of the sun was obliterated, and for
the first time since the big blizzard, the Arctic
sky was overcast with clouds.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill took the lead with McDougall's
big ten-team, Connie followed with his own
three dogs, while O'Brien, with Waseche's team,
brought up the rear. The sleds slipped smoothly
over the dry frost spicules, and the eyes of the
three adventurers eagerly sought the edges of
the high cliffs for signs of the White Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
But no living, moving thing was visible, and, save
for the occasional creak of runners, the white,
frozen world was a world of silence.</p>

<p>A half-hour later the <i>malamutes</i> headed up
the ravine and humped to the pull of the long
ascent. Rapidly, the weather thickened, and
when, at last, they gained the bench, it was to
gaze out upon an eerie, flat, white world of fore-shortened
horizon. The sleds were halted while
the three took their bearings. O'Brien pointed
unhesitatingly toward the opaque west, and
Waseche swung McDougall's leaders.</p>

<p>"Mush yo'! Mush yo'!" he yelled. "Hooray
fo' Alaska!"</p>

<p>"An' Flor-ridy, too!" yelled O'Brien, and then
a puff of wind&mdash;chill wind, that felt strangely
clammy and damp in the intense cold, came out
of the North. The long, serpentine bank of frozen
fog that marked the course of the Ignatook, shuddered
and writhed and eddied, while ragged patches
of frozen rack detached themselves and flew
swiftly southward. The air was filled with a dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
roar, and a scattering of steel-like pellets hissed
earthward. A loud cry pierced the roar of the
approaching storm, and before them stood a
solitary White Indian, immovable as a statue,
with one arm pointing into the North. For a
long moment he stood and then, in a whirl of
flying spume, disappeared in the direction of the
village.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys!" cried Connie, and his voice
sounded far and thin. "Dig in! 'Cause we're
right now <i>fighting the North</i>!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE SNOW TRAIL</p>


<p>The situation faced by Connie Morgan, Waseche
Bill, and O'Brien when they headed westward
across the snow-ridden bench of the Lillimuit,
was anything but encouraging. Before them,
they knew, lay Alaska. But how many unmapped
miles, and what barriers of frozen desert
and insurmountable mountains interposed, they
did not know; nor did they know the location
of the Kandik, the river by which Carlson had
returned to the land of men. For Carlson's trail
map lay hidden in the pocket of O'Brien's discarded
trousers in an <i>igloo</i> in the village of the
White Indians, and upon their own worth must
the three win&mdash;or die.</p>

<p>There was no turning back now. No returning
to the Ignatook to face starvation and the melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the snow, for the solitary Indian who witnessed
their departure had dashed to the village, bearing
the information to his tribe.</p>

<p>If O'Brien were right in his conjecture that the
Indians would not venture into the open in a
storm, there would, in all probability, be several
days in which to escape, for Arctic storms are
rarely of short duration. This seeming advantage,
however, was offset by the fact that, at best, the
storm would seriously impede their own progress,
and at worst&mdash;well, if the worst happened, it
would make no smallest particle of difference
whether the White Indians picked up their trail
soon, or late.</p>

<p>After the first fierce rush had passed, the storm
lulled and settled into a steady drive of wind-hurled
pellets that cut the thick air in long,
stinging slants. The dry, shot-like particles
burned and bit at the faces of the three, and
danced and whirled merrily across the hard surface
of the snow to drift deep against obstructions.
The dogs were in fine condition, well fed, and thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>oughly
rested during the days of inactivity, and
they strung out to the pull with a will. The trail
was fast. The hard crust of the old snow gave
excellent footing and the three heavily loaded
sleds slipped smoothly and steadily in the wake of
Waseche Bill, who piloted the expedition at a
long, swinging trot, with Connie and O'Brien
running beside their respective sleds.</p>

<p>It was well past noon when the start was made,
and the thick gloom of a starless night settled upon
the storm-swept bench as the little cavalcade
reached O'Brien's "bit av a mountain," and swung
into the shelter of the thicket upon its lee side.
The dogs were unharnessed and fed, a fire
lighted, and a snug camp sprang into existence
under the deft movements of the experienced
<i>tillicums</i>.</p>

<p>"'Tis a foine shtar-rt we've made," said O'Brien,
as he poured melted suet over the caribou
steak upon his tin plate, "but they'll be lookin'
f'r us here, f'r they've dhrug me out av th' scrub
on this hill a full dozen av toimes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll hit the trail at daylight," answered
Waseche Bill.</p>

<p>"Ut slues to th' Narth a bit from here. Oi've
thr-ravelled th' nixt tin moile or so, but beyant
that Oi've niver be'n able to git."</p>

<p>All night the hard, dry snow fell, and all night
the wind swept out of the North with a low,
monotonous roar. By the light of the flaring
fire they breakfasted, and at the first hint of dawn
again took the trail. A dreary scene confronted
the little party that pulled heavily out of the
sheltered thicket. All about them was the
whirling, driving whiteness, and beneath their
feet the loose, dry snow shifted and they sank
ankle deep into the yielding mass. The sleds
pulled hard, so that the dogs clawed for footing,
and the snowshoes were placed conveniently
upon the top of the packs, for soon the rackets
would be necessary in the fast deepening snow.</p>

<p>O'Brien insisted that the trail "slued to the
Narth a bit," and as there was nothing for it
but to follow the Irishman's vague direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Waseche changed the course, a proceeding that
added materially to the discomfort of the journey,
as it forced them to travel more nearly into the
teeth of the wind. At noon a halt was made for
luncheon and a brief rest in the shelter of the close-drawn
sleds. During the last hour the character
of the storm had changed and the wind whipped
upon them in veering gusts that struck furiously
from every point of the compass at once. The
snow, too, changed, and the hard, dry pellets gave
place to a fine, powdery snow-dust that filled the
eyes and nostrils and worked uncomfortably
beneath the clothing. Snow-shoes were fastened
on, and with lowered heads and muffled faces
the three headed again into the unknown.</p>

<p>With the coming of darkness, they camped at
the fork of a frozen river where a sparse growth of
stunted willow gave promise of firewood and scant
shelter. They were in a new world, now&mdash;a
world, trackless and unknown, for during the afternoon
they had passed beyond O'Brien's farthest
venture and the Irishman was as ignorant of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
lay before them as were Connie and Waseche Bill,
who knew only that they were in the midst of a
trackless void of seething snow, with the White
Indians behind them and Alaska before&mdash;and
all about them, death, grim and silent, and gaunt&mdash;death
that stalked close, ready on the instant to
take its toll, as it had taken its toll from other
men who had braved the Lillimuit and never again
returned.</p>

<p>"She's a <i>reg'lah</i> blizzahd, now," remarked
Waseche, as he lighted his pipe with a brand from
the camp-fire. "Any otheh time, we'd lay by an'
wait fo' it to weah down&mdash;but, we dastn't stop."</p>

<p>"The Indians will never pick up our trail when
this storm quits," ventured Connie.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;'ceptin' they're wise that we-all tuck
out this-away, havin' followed O'Brien almost
this fah befo'."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;her-re, or her-re abouts," assented the
Irishman, "we nade an-nyways wan mor-re day
av thrailin' before we hole up, an' me'be be that
toime th' star-rm will be wor-re out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the third day they again
started in the dull grey of the dawn. Waseche,
with lowered head, bored through the white
smother that surrounded them like a wall of
frozen fog. The dogs, still in good heart, humped
bravely to the pull, and Connie and O'Brien,
with hands clutching the tail-ropes of the sleds,
followed blindly. On and on they plodded, halting
at intervals only long enough to consult the
compass, for with nothing to sight by, they held
their course by the aid of the needle alone.</p>

<p>Suddenly Connie's sled stopped so abruptly
that the boy tripped and sprawled at full length
beside its canvas-covered pack, while behind him,
Waseche's leaders, in charge of O'Brien, swerved
sharply to avoid the savage fangs of Slasher&mdash;for
the wolf-dog knew his kind&mdash;he knew that,
once down, a man is <i>meat</i>, and the moment the
boy fell helpless into the snow, the great, gaunt
brute surged back in the traces, jerking old Boris
and Mutt with him, and stood guard over the
prostrate form of his master, where he growled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
defiance into the faces of the dogs of the following
team. Scrambling hastily to his feet, Connie
was joined by O'Brien and together they stumbled
forward where McDougall's big ten-team had
piled up in a growling, snapping tangle upon the
very brink of a perpendicular precipice. For the
leaders had leaped back from the edge so suddenly
that they fouled the swing dogs which, with tooth
and nail, and throaty growl, were protesting
against the indignity.</p>

<p>"Where's Waseche!" The voice of the boy
cut high and thin above the roar of the storm-choked
wind, and O'Brien ceased abruptly his
endeavour to straighten out the fighting <i>malamutes</i>.
He stumbled hastily to the boy's side,
but Waseche was no place to be seen, and upon
the verge of the chasm, the overhanging snow-rim
was gouged deep and fresh with a man-made
scar.</p>

<p>The dogs were forgotten, and for a long moment
the two stood peering over the edge, striving to
penetrate the writhing whirl of snow-powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that filled the yawning abyss&mdash;but the opaque
mass gave no hint of the depth or extent of the
chasm. Again and again they shouted, but
their voices were drowned in the bellow of the
wind, and to their ears was borne no faintest
answering call.</p>

<p>To Connie Morgan it seemed, at last, he had
come to the end of the trail. A strange numbness
overcame him that dulled his senses and paralyzed
his brain. His mind groped uncertainly....
Waseche was gone! He had fallen over the edge
of the cliff and was lying at the bottom&mdash;and they
would find him there&mdash;the men who were to come&mdash;and
himself and O'Brien they would find at
the top&mdash;and the dogs were all tangled&mdash;and it
would be better, now, to sleep. No&mdash;they must
push on&mdash;they were on the trail.... Where were
they going? Oh, yes, to Alaska&mdash;back to Ten Bow,
and the cabin, and the claim! But they couldn't
go on.... This was the <i>end</i>.... They had
come to the place where the world breaks off&mdash;and
Waseche had fallen over the edge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy gazed stupidly into the milky, eddying
chaos. It looked soft, down there&mdash;like feathers,
or the meringue on pie. It is a good place to
fall, he thought, this place where the world stops&mdash;you
could fall, and fall, and fall, and you wouldn't
have to light&mdash;and it would be fun. The Lillimuit
was a funny place, anyway&mdash;"the country where
men don't come back from," Joe had said, that
night&mdash;back there in the hotel at Eagle. Carlson
didn't come back&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Carlson's dead!" he cried so sharply
that, at his side, O'Brien started.</p>

<p>"Sur-re, b'y, he's dead&mdash;but&mdash;" The man's
voice aroused him as from a dream. His brain
cleared, and suddenly he realized that Waseche
Bill was lost&mdash;was even then lying wounded&mdash;probably
dead, at the bottom of the cliff. With
a low, choking sob, the boy whirled on O'Brien,
who jumped at the sharp word of command:</p>

<p>"Get the ropes! Quick! While I unharness
the dogs!" The Irishman sprang to the rear
sled where two forty-foot coils of <i>babiche</i> line lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
ready for just such an emergency, while Connie
sprang among McDougall's tangled <i>malamutes</i>,
slashing right and left with his coiled whiplash.
At the sudden attack the dogs ceased fighting
and cowered whimpering while the boy slipped
their collars, and by the time O'Brien returned
with the lines, Connie was ready for the next
move.</p>

<p>"Work the sled closer&mdash;crossways! <i>Crossways</i>&mdash;so
she'll hold!" he cried, as he knotted the lines
securely together and made an end fast about his
body.</p>

<p>"Brace against the sled, now, and lower away!"</p>

<p>"Phwat ye goin' to do?" asked the man, eyeing
the line.</p>

<p>"<i>Do!</i> I'm going after Waseche, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, ye don't know how daype ut is&mdash;an' th'
rope moight bre'k!"</p>

<p>"What difference does <i>that</i> make?" cried the
boy. "If the rope won't reach&mdash;we'll make it
reach! We'll splice on the harness, and the
blankets, and the tarps, and the robes, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>ever
else we can lay our hands on&mdash;and if it don't
reach then, we'll kill the dogs! I'll get my pardner
out of there if I have to kill every dog in the outfit
and use their hides. And if the rope breaks&mdash;I'll
be where Waseche is, anyway!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/i-p262.jpg" width="660" height="260" alt="Without waiting for a reply, Connie slipped softly over the edge." title="Without waiting for a reply, Connie slipped softly over the edge." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Without waiting for a reply, Connie slipped softly over the edge.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, the boy seated
himself in the snow and slipped softly over the
edge. Slowly he descended into the riot of whirling
snow, while above him, O'Brien, with heels
braced against the runners of the heavy sled, carefully
paid out the line. Down, down, he went,
scraping and bumping against the wall. It
seemed to the impatient boy as though each moment
he must reach the end of his rope&mdash;surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
he had descended eighty feet! But on he went,
down, down, down&mdash;and then, when the suspense
was becoming almost unbearable, his feet touched
bottom, and he stood upright upon the snow.
And, above, O'Brien felt the line go slack, and
heaved a great sigh of relief as he glanced at the
scant six feet of rope that remained.</p>

<p>Jagged rock-slivers protruded from the snow,
here and there, at the base of the cliff, and Connie
shuddered as he gazed about him. Suddenly he
cried out, and plunged to the end of his line, for
there, close beside a huge block of stone, he made
out a dark blur on the white surface of the snow&mdash;it
was the back of a fur <i>parka</i>!</p>

<p>The next instant, the boy was kneeling beside
the inert form of Waseche Bill. Frantically he
pulled and hauled at the man until at length he
succeeded in turning him upon his back, and then
it was he noticed the leg doubled curiously beneath
him. Very gently Connie laid hold of the
foot and drew it into position beside the other,
and as the leg straightened out he could feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the grating rasp of bone on bone&mdash;the leg was
broken!</p>

<p>His first thought was to arouse the unconscious
man, but instead he began swiftly to remove the
rope from about his own body and fasten it firmly
under Waseche's armpits.</p>

<p>"If I wake him up now, it will hurt like thunder
when O'Brien hauls him up," he muttered, as he
gave the three quick jerks to the line that had
been the agreed signal to "haul away." The next
moment the rope went taut, and slowly, very
slowly, the inanimate form lifted and swung clear
of the snow.</p>

<p>O'Brien was a big man&mdash;and a strong one. But
for the next few minutes he had his work cut out.</p>

<p>"He's found um!" he panted, as he paused to
rest, with the rope wrapped tightly about his arm.
"Sur-re, th' b'y's niver as heavy as that&mdash;an',
be jabbers! Oi belayve th' two av thim's cumin'
up to wanst."</p>

<p>At length Waseche's body wedged against the
edge of the cliff and O'Brien, making the line fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the heavy sled, dragged the unconscious form
clear, and weighting the line with an ice ax,
lowered it into the chasm. Five minutes later
the boy scrambled over the rim, and dropped to
his knees beside the inert form in the snow.</p>

<p>"Get up the shelter tarp&mdash;quick!" he ordered,
as he scraped the loose snow from a wide space
near the sled and, rummaging in his pack, produced
a quantity of grease-soaked moss and a
bundle of dry firewood.</p>

<p>"His leg's broken, and we've got to set it,"
he explained, as a tiny flame flared in the shelter
of the wide tarpaulin, and he proceeded to remove
the man's <i>mukluk</i> and heavy socks.</p>

<p>"Ye'll fr-reeze his leg!" exclaimed O'Brien,
in alarm.</p>

<p>"Can't help it&mdash;we've got to take a chance.
He'll die, or be crippled for life if we don't set it&mdash;so
here goes!"</p>

<p>The foot was badly swollen, and midway between
the ankle and the knee was a great bluish-green
bruise where the leg had struck the rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
at the foot of the cliff. The blow had broken
both bones, and the overlapping ends made an
unsightly bunch upon the side of the leg. Deftly
and skilfully the boy's fingers explored the hurt.</p>

<p>"We've got to pull 'em by and snap 'em into
place," he explained. "I know how&mdash;we set Newt
Boyer's legs, in Ten Bow, when a log rolled on
him."</p>

<p>Again they made the line fast beneath the man's
shoulders, and bound him firmly to the loaded
sled. O'Brien seized hold of the foot and, bracing
himself in the snow, pulled for all he was worth,
while Connie pressed against the bone ends with
his palms.</p>

<p>"Pull! <i>Pull</i>&mdash;can't you!" urged the boy.
"Only a quarter of an inch more and they'll
click&mdash;and the job will be done!" But O'Brien
was pulling, and although he strained and tugged
to the very limit of his strength, the ends still
overlapped. Suddenly the boy leaped to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Swing those dogs in here!" he cried, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to Waseche's team that remained still harnessed.
"A little farther! Woah! That'll do&mdash;now,
wait!" Swiftly he stooped, and with a few quick
turns, bound the injured foot tightly to the back
of the sled.</p>

<p>"Now, pull up&mdash;easy, at first&mdash;don't jerk!
That's right!" he cried, as the leg stretched taut,
"now, make 'em <i>pull</i>!"</p>

<p>Again the boy dropped to his knees and worked
rapidly with his fingers, while under O'Brien's
urging Waseche's <i>malamutes</i> humped and clawed
as they pulled. There was a slight click, as the
bone-ends snapped into place, and the Irishman
heard the delighted voice of the boy:</p>

<p>"Woah! She's set! She's set! Ease off, now,
and hand me the splints!"</p>

<p>The splints, rudely split from pieces of firewood,
were applied and held in place by strips torn
from the tarp, a blanket was wrapped about the
injured member, and the patient made as comfortable
as possible beside the fire in the lee of the
shelter tarp. But it was an hour later before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Waseche Bill opened his eyes and gazed inquiringly
about him.</p>

<p>"What happened?" he asked, as a sharp pain
caused him to stare in surprise toward his blanket-swathed
leg.</p>

<p>"Sur-re, ye walked over th' edge av a clift, an' lit
on th' rocks, a mather av siventy feet below&mdash;an'
th' b'y, here, wuz over an' afther yez befoor ye lit.
Yer leg's bruk squar-re in two, but th' lad set ut
loike an-ny docther c'd done&mdash;an' bether thin most."</p>

<p>"O'Brien helped!" interrupted Connie.</p>

<p>"Aye, a bit. An' so did the dogs. But, th'
b'y&mdash;he wuz th' captain. Ye sh'd o' seed um
shlip over th' edge on th' ind av his thread av a
loine, into th' whirlin' scather av shnow, when
ye c'd see nayther bottom nor soides. 'Oi'm
a-goin afther Waseche!' he says&mdash;An' he done so."</p>

<p>"O'Brien pulled you up," said the boy, as
Waseche leaned over and grasped the small hand
in his own big one. He spoke no word, but in the
pressure of the mighty hand-grasp the boy read
the man-sign of <i>tillicums</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">ALASKA!</p>


<p>They camped for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>"'Tain't no use grumblin' on ouh luck," remarked
the philosophical Waseche. "We got to
camp right heah till the stawm weahs out. Chances
is, we'll have the Injuns onto us in a day oah so;
but we cain't go bluste'catin' no mo' wheah we
cain't see. Anyhow, they ain't no use borrowin'
trouble&mdash;theh's a right smaht of it a-comin' to a
man without him huntin' none. So fah, we're
all to the good. The big Nawth's fightin' to hold
her secrets, but she ain't handed us no knockout&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>During the night the storm ceased, and with
the first hint of dawn the outfit was made ready
for the trail. Robes were spread upon Connie's
light sled, and Waseche Bill placed in his sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>ing
bag and bound securely upon the robes with
many turns of <i>babiche</i>. The bundles of firewood,
and O'Brien's cans of gold were transferred
to the other sleds, and in the dull grey
of the long morning twilight the outfit pulled
southward over the bench, paralleling the edge
of the ravine into which Waseche had fallen.
Progress was slow. The fresh snow rolled up
and clogged the free running of the sleds, so
that both Connie and O'Brien mushed ahead of
the dogs, breaking out the trail with their rackets.
Hour after hour they mushed, seeking to cross the
great fissure that gaped wide and deep between
them and the distant mountains that loomed
white and grand against the western skyline&mdash;the
mountains that separated them from Alaska, and
through whose fastnesses they must find a trail.</p>

<p>The belated sun peeped over the rim of the
flat snow tundra behind them, and all three
turned to view the welcome sight. Suddenly,
O'Brien, with a sharp cry, pointed toward some
tiny moving objects far to the eastward:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Injuns," he cried. "That haythen,
Lemlak&mdash;th' wan that seen us layve th' Ignatook&mdash;he's
put um on our thr-rail&mdash;an' ut's back we
go, av they don't har-rpoon us&mdash;as sur-re's me
name's Pathrick O'Brien!"</p>

<p>"It's back we <i>don't</i> go! And you can bet
your bottom dollar on that!" cried Connie, as he
glanced with flashing eyes toward the two high-power
rifles lashed side by side against the rail of
McDougall's sled. "Look! There's the end of
the ravine! We can head west now, and hit for
the mountains!"</p>

<p>"Sur-re, they'll ketch up to us, befoor we git
foive moile&mdash;we've got to bre'k thr-rail, an'
they'll folly along in ut."</p>

<p>They were drawing nearer to the white expanse
that Connie had pointed out as the end of the
ravine.</p>

<p>"Ut ain't th' ind! Ut's a shnow bridge!"
exclaimed O'Brien, and the others saw, extending
from side to side of the chasm, gleaming white in the
slanting rays of the sun, an enormous snow arch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i-p272.jpg" width="577" height="658" alt="Recklessly O'Brien rushed out upon the glittering span of snow
while Connie and Waseche watched breathlessly" title="Recklessly O&#39;Brien rushed out upon the glittering span of snow while Connie and Waseche watched breathlessly" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Recklessly O&#39;Brien rushed out upon the glittering span of snow
while Connie and Waseche watched breathlessly.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Without waiting for a line, O'Brien rushed out
upon the glittering span, while Connie and
Waseche watched breathlessly. The great mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of snow that bridged the chasm looked as solid as
the rock of Gibraltar, but the partners heaved a
sigh of relief as the man reached the opposite
side in safety and turned to retrace his steps.
Connie's team, drawing the injured man, crossed
first and was quickly followed by the two more
heavily loaded sleds.</p>

<p>"Now, let's hit for the mountains!" cried the
boy, "we've got miles and miles on them yet."</p>

<p>"Hold on, son. We got lots of time, now.
'Spose yo' jes' bust open one of them theah
bundles of wood an' staht us a little camp-fiah."</p>

<p>"A camp-fire!" exclaimed the boy, "why,
it isn't time to camp! And, besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neveh yo' mind about that. Jes' do as
I said, an' then swing that theah pack of mine
around heah an' prop me up agin' it beside the
fiah. Afteh that, I want yo' an' O'Brien to take
Mac's dawgs an' yo'n an' wo'k yo' way to the top
of yondeh hill an' see if yo' c'n find out how fah
this heah ravine runs&mdash;get busy, now."</p>

<p>The boy obeyed without question and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
he and the Irishman were headed for the hill a
quarter of a mile up the ravine.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he's up to?" speculated the
boy, with puckered brow. "You don't suppose
it's his leg&mdash;fever, or something, that's made
him kind of&mdash;of queer?"</p>

<p>"No, no, lad. Oi don't know phwat's on his
moind&mdash;but min loike him&mdash;they mostly knows
phwat they're doin'&mdash;er they wouldn't be doin' ut."</p>

<p>From the top of the hill they saw that, as
far as the eye could reach, the ravine cut the tundra
in an unbroken line.</p>

<p>"They ain't no other cr-rossin'," said O'Brien,
so they retraced their steps to the bridge, where
they could see Waseche bending close over the tiny
fire.</p>

<p>"Why, he's frying some meat!" exclaimed
Connie, "and we just had breakfast!" They
were close now, and Waseche removed a frying
pan from the flame and poked gingerly at its
contents with a piece of brushwood. Apparently
satisfied, he placed it beside him upon the snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Connie glanced into the pan where, instead of
a caribou steak, the boy saw three yellow sticks
of dynamite.</p>

<p>"Why, you told me&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, kid, I done tol' yo' long ago, neveh
to thaw out no giant in a pan&mdash;an' I meant it!
Mos'ly, yo' c'n do it&mdash;if yo' careful&mdash;but, sometimes
she jes' nachelly lets go, without no provocation,
an' then&mdash;well, yo' rec'lect how we-all wiped
po' Gus Meekin offen the bushes an' rocks, a half
a mile from wheah his fiah was."</p>

<p>"But, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, son. This heah was a pahtic'lah
case. I figgehed it all out&mdash;an' took a chanct.
That's why I sent yo' an' O'Brien oveh onto the
hill, so's if she let go they'd still be some of us
left. Soon as I seen the bridge I rec'lected how
I had a dozen sticks of giant in my outfit, an' a
box of caps, an' some fuse&mdash;wait, now, till I set
the caps, an' then yo' c'n touch off the shot.
We'll use two sticks fust, an' save the otheh to
finish off with, if we need it." As he talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Waseche Bill punched holes in the soft yellow
cylinders and affixed the caps and fuse for a ten-minute
shot. Connie and O'Brien placed the
injured man again upon the sled and made ready
for a quick getaway.</p>

<p>"Lay 'em side by side right in the middle, an'
coveh 'em with a couple handfuls of snow,"
advised Waseche, "an' then we'll pull out on the
flat a space an' watch the fun. When them
Injuns gets to the ravine it sho' will botheh 'em to
figgeh how we-all got acrost."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they halted the outfit
well out of harm's way and watched breathlessly
for the explosion. The mining of the bridge
had taken time and, in the distance, beyond the
ravine, the White Indians were rapidly gaining.
A few of the stronger and more fleet were well
within rifle shot, when suddenly, with a dull
roar and a blur of flying snow, the giant let go.
The eyes of the three were fixed upon the bridge&mdash;or
rather upon the place where the bridge had
been&mdash;for all that remained was a cloud of powdery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
snow dust and a thinning haze of light grey smoke.
The snow dust settled, the smoke drifted away
and dissolved into the cold, clear air, and between
the watchers and the White Indians the unbridged
ravine yawned wide, and deep, and impassable.</p>

<p>"Whoop-la!" yelled O'Brien, leaping into the
air and cracking his heels together. "Come on an'
git us, ye phirates!" And as the savages gathered
upon the opposite side, the Irishman's laughter
rang long and loud across the frozen tundra.</p>

<p>The third day after the blowing up of the
bridge found the three adventurers skirting the
base of the great white range that towered in an
unbroken chain as far as the eye could reach to
the northward and to the southward. Vast, and
grim, and impassable, the giant masses of rock
and ice loomed above them, their naked, blue-white
peaks and pinnacles gleaming clean-cut
and cold against the cloudless turquoise of the sky.</p>

<p>All day long the three dog teams mushed northward
while Connie, and Waseche Bill, and O'Brien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
anxiously scanned the great barrier for signs of a
river or creek that gave promise of leading to a
divide. For, though they passed the mouths of
dozens of creeks and canyons, none were sufficiently
large to tempt exploration.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill's injured leg was much swollen,
for the trail was rough and tortuous, and despite
the utmost efforts of Connie and O'Brien, the light
sled bumped and slued against obstructions in a
manner that caused the man excruciating torture,
although neither by sign nor sound, did he betray
the slightest pain. The Irishman and the boy took
turns breaking trail for McDougall's leaders, and
working at the gee-pole to ease the light sled over
the rough places. Waseche's own dogs followed
McDougall's, thus giving a smoother trail to the
sled bearing the injured man.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well spent when Connie,
who was in the rear, noticed a growing uneasiness
among the dogs of Waseche's team. The big
<i>malamutes</i> whined and whimpered with a peculiar
suppressed eagerness as they eyed the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and, pulling close, tried time and again to pass
the lead sled.</p>

<p>"That's funny," thought the boy, as he watched
the dogs closely, "I never saw those dogs act like
that before&mdash;seems like they wanted to lead."
Hour after hour the boy mushed at the tail rope,
and always he watched the strange behaviour of
Waseche Bill's dogs. The sun sank behind the
mountains and, at last, O'Brien halted at the
edge of a patch of scraggy spruce. The dogs were
unharnessed and fed, and after Waseche was made
comfortable at the fireside, Connie prepared
supper.</p>

<p>Suddenly, all three were startled by the long
howl of a sled dog and, turning quickly saw
Waseche's huge leader standing with up-pointing
muzzle, upon a low hill, some fifty yards distant,
and about him stood the seven dogs of his team.
Again he howled, and then, as though this were
the signal, the whole pack turned tail and dashed
into the North.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the doggone, ornery tricks I eveh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
heahed tell of&mdash;that takes the cake!" cried
Waseche. "Pulled out on us! Jes' plumb pulled
out! An' them's good dawgs, too!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get that team?" asked Connie
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Picked 'em up off a man in Eagle," answered
Waseche. "He aimed to go outside, come spring.
He got 'em off a breed, a yeah back."</p>

<p>"Where do you s'pose they've gone?" asked
the boy.</p>

<p>"Sea'ch me! I cain't onde'stand it."</p>

<p>"Ut's th' Lillimuit!" croaked O'Brien. "Ut
wuz th' same wid Craik an' Greenhow!" The
man shuddered and drew closer to the fire. "They's
things here that ondly some c'n see! An' phwin
they see um&mdash;always they head into th' Narth!"</p>

<p>"Sho'! Quit yo' calamatatin', O'Brien! Dawgs
has pulled out on folks befo'."</p>

<p>"Thim wans ain't," returned the Irishman,
and relapsed into gloomy silence.</p>

<p>With the first sign of dawn the outfit was again
on the trail. The bulk of the pack had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
removed from Waseche's sled and added to the
other two, and the sled and harness <i>cached</i> in the
bush. For several miles Connie, who was travelling
in the lead, followed the trail of the stampeded
dog-pack, when suddenly he paused where a
narrow creek canyon clove the rock-wall of a
mountain. The trail led into the gorge, which
appeared to be a mere crack in the mighty wall.</p>

<p>"Follow 'em up, son!" called Waseche from his
sled. "We need them dawgs."</p>

<p>So the boy swung McDougall's team into
the canyon, and his own dogs followed, with
O'Brien fast to the tail rope. On and on led the
narrow trail&mdash;westward, and upward, winding
and twisting between its rocky walls&mdash;but always
westward, and upward. The floor was surprisingly
smooth for so narrow a trail, and the outfit made
good time, but all three expected that each turn
would be the last, and that they would find the
runaway dogs huddled against a dead end. Toward
midday, the canyon grew lighter, the walls
seemed not so high, and the ascent grew steeper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Suddenly, as they rounded a sharp turn, a brilliant
patch of sunlight burst upon them, and the next
moment they found themselves upon the summit
of a long divide.</p>

<p>Never in their lives had any of the three gazed
upon so welcome a sight, for there, to the westward,
lay an unending chaos of high-flung peaks
and narrow valleys, and easily traceable&mdash;leading
in a broad path of white to the south-westward,
was the smooth trail of a river!</p>

<p>"The Kandik!" cried Connie, "and <i>Alaska</i>!"</p>

<p>"H-o-o-r-a-y!" yelled O'Brien, dancing about
in the snow, while the tears streamed unheeded
from his eyes. "Ut's good-bye Lillimuit, foriver!
Av ye wuz pure gold from th' middle av th' wor-rld

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class ="tdc">ON THE KANDIK</p>


<p>To the conqueror of far places comes disaster
in many guises&mdash;to the sailor who sails the uncharted
seas, and to the adventurer who pushes
past the outposts into the unmapped land of the
long snow trails. For the lone, drear lands are
lands of primal things&mdash;lands rugged and grim,
where life is the right of the strongest and only the
fit survive.</p>

<p>Men die when ships, in the grip of the fierce
hurricane, are buried beneath crashing waves or
dashed against the rocks of a towering cliff;
and men die in blizzards and earthquakes and in
the belching fire of volcanoes and amid the roar
and smoke of burning forests&mdash;but these men
<i>expect</i> to die. They match their puny strength
against the mighty fury of the elements and meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
death gladly&mdash;or win through to glory in the
adventure. Such battles with the giants of nature
strike no horror to the hearts of men&mdash;they are
recounted with a laugh. Not so the death that
lurks where nature smiles. Calm waters beneath
their sparkling surface conceal sharp fangs of rock
that rip the bottom from an unsuspecting ship;
a beautiful mirage paints upon the shimmering
horizon a picture of cool, green shade and crystal
pools, and thirst-choked men are lured farther
into the springless desert; the smooth, velvety
surface of quicksand pits and "soap-holes" beguiles
the unsuspecting feet of the weary traveller;
and the warm Chinook wind softens the deep snow
beneath a smiling winter sky. In all these things
is death&mdash;a sardonic, derisive death that lurks
unseen and unsuspected for its prey. But the
claws of the tiger are none the less sharp because
concealed between soft pads. And the men who
win through the unseen death never recount their
story with a laugh. These men are silent. Or, if
they speak at all, it is in low, tense tones, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
clenched fists, and many pauses between the words,
and into their eyes creeps the look of unveiled
horror.</p>

<p>Connie Morgan, Waseche Bill, and O'Brien
laboriously worked the outfit down the steep trail
that led from the divide to the snow-buried surface
of the Kandik. The distance, in an air line,
was possibly three miles&mdash;by the steep and winding
caribou trail it was ten. And each mile was a
mile of gruelling toil with axe and shovel and tail-rope
and brake-pole, for the snow lay deep upon
the trail which twisted and doubled interminably,
narrowing in places to a mere shelf high upon
the side of a sheer rock wall. At such spots Connie
and O'Brien took turns with axe and shovel,
heaving the snow into the canyon; for to venture
upon the drifts, high-piled upon the edge of the
precipice, would have been to invite instant
disaster.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill, despite the pain of his broken leg,
insisted upon being propped into position to
brake his own sled. It was the heavier sled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
double-freighted by reason of the stampede of
Waseche's dogs, that caused Connie and O'Brien
the hardest labour; for its loss meant death by
exposure and starvation.</p>

<p>Night overtook them with scarce half the
distance behind them, and they camped on a
small plateau overlooking a deep ravine.</p>

<p>Morning found them again at their work in the
face of a stiff gale from the south-west. The sun
rose and hung low in the cloudless sky above the
sea of gleaming white peaks. The mercury
expanded in the tube of the thermometer and the
wind lost its chill. Connie and O'Brien removed
their heavy <i>parkas</i>, and Waseche Bill threw back
his hood and frowned uneasily:</p>

<p>"Sho' wisht this heah Chinook w'd helt off about
ten days mo'," he said. "I ain't acquainted
through heah, but I reckon nine oah ten days had
ort to put us into Eagle if the snow holds."</p>

<p>"It's too early for the break-up!" exclaimed
Connie.</p>

<p>"Yeh, fo' the break-up, it is. But these heah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Chinooks yo' cain't count on. I've saw three foot
of snow melt in a night an' a day&mdash;an' then tuhn
'round an' freeze up fo' two months straight. If
this heah wind don't shift oah die down again
tomorrow mo'nin', we ah goin' to have to hole
up an' wait fo' a freeze."</p>

<p>"The grub won't hold out long," ventured
Connie, eyeing the sled. "But there must be
game on this side of the divide."</p>

<p>"They betteh be! I sho' do hate it&mdash;bein'
crippled up this-a-way an' leavin' yo'-all to do
the wo'k."</p>

<p>"Niver 'yez moind about that!" exclaimed
O'Brien. "Sur-re, we'd all be wor-rkin' as
har-rd as we could an-nyways, an' ut w'dn't make
ut no aisyer f'r us bekase ye was wor-rkin',
too. Jist set ye by an' shmoke yer poipe, an'
me an' th' b'y'll have us on th' river be noon."</p>

<p>By dint of hard labour and much snubbing and
braking, O'Brien's prediction was fulfilled and
the midday meal was eaten upon the snow-covered
ice of the Kandik.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"All aboard for Eagle!" cried Connie, as he
cracked his long-lashed whip and led out upon the
broad river trail. And McDougall's big <i>malamutes</i>
as though they understood the boy's words, humped
to the pull and the heavily loaded sled slipped
smoothly over the surface of the softening snow.
Upon the trail from the divide, protected from
wind and sun by high walls, the snow had remained
stiff and hard, but here on the river the sled runners
left deep ruts behind them, and not infrequently
slumped through, so that Connie and O'Brien
were forced to stop and pry them out, and also
to knock the balls of packed snow from the webs
of their rackets.</p>

<p>"Saints be praised, ut's a house!" called
O'Brien, as toward evening he halted at a sharp
bend of the river and pointed toward a tiny cabin
that nestled in a grove of balsam at the edge of
the high cut-bank.</p>

<p>"Ut's th' fur-rst wan Oi've seed in six year&mdash;barrin'
thim haythen <i>igloos</i> av' dhrift-wood an'
shnow blocks! We'll shtay th' night wid um,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
whoiver they ar-re&mdash;an' happy Oi'll be wid a
Christian roof over me head wanst more!"</p>

<p>The outfit was headed for the cabin and a
quarter of an hour later they swung into the small
clearing before the door.</p>

<p>"Them dawgs has be'n heah," remarked Waseche
Bill, as he eyed the trodden snow. "Don't
reckon nobody's to home." O'Brien pushed
open the door and entered, closely followed by
Connie.</p>

<p>Save for a rude bunk built against the wall,
and a rusted sheet-iron stove, the cabin was
empty, and despite the peculiar musty smell of an
abandoned building, the travellers were glad to
avail themselves of its shelter. Waseche Bill
was made comfortable with robes and blankets,
and while O'Brien unharnessed the dogs and
rustled the firewood, Connie unloaded the outfit
and carried it inside. The sun had long set, but
with the withdrawal of its heat the snow had
not stiffened and the wind held warm.</p>

<p>"Betteh let in the dawgs, tonight, son," ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>vised
Waseche, "I'm 'fraid we ah in fo' a thaw.
Still it mout tuhn cold in the night an' freeze
'em into the snow."</p>

<p>"How long will it last&mdash;the thaw?" asked
the boy, as he eyed the supply of provisions.</p>

<p>"Yo' cain't tell. Two days&mdash;me'be three&mdash;sometimes
a week&mdash;then, anyway, one day mo',
till she freezes solid."</p>

<p>"O'Brien and I will have to hunt then&mdash;grub's
getting low."</p>

<p>"We'll see how it looks tomorrow. If it's like
I think, yo' ain't a-goin' to be able to get fah to do
no huntin'. The snow'll be like mush."</p>

<p>As O'Brien tossed the last armful upon his pile
of firewood, Connie announced supper, and the
three ate in silence&mdash;as hungry men eat.</p>

<p>Worn out by the long, hard day on the trail,
all slept soundly, and when they awoke it was to
find the depressions in the dirt floor filled with
water which entered through a crack beneath the
door.</p>

<p>"We-all ah sho' 'nough tied up, now," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Waseche, as he eyed the tiny trickle. "How
much grub we got?" Connie explored the pack.</p>

<p>"Three or four days. We better cut the dogs
to half-ration."</p>

<p>"Them an' us, both," replied the man in the
bunk, and groaned as a hot pain shot through his
injured leg.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Connie picked up his rifle,
fastened on his snowshoes, and stepped on the
wind-softened snow. He had taken scarcely a half-dozen
steps when he was forced to halt&mdash;anchored
fast in the soggy snow. In vain he tried to raise
first one foot and then the other&mdash;it was no use.
The snow clung to his rackets in huge balls and
after repeated efforts he loosened the thongs and
stepped on the melting snow, into which he
promptly sank to his middle. He freed his rackets,
tossed them toward the cabin, and wallowed to the
door.</p>

<p>"Back a'ready?" grinned Waseche. "How's
the huntin'?" Connie laughed.</p>

<p>"You wait&mdash;I haven't started yet!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Betteh keep inside, son. Yo' cain't do no
good out theah. They cain't no game move in a
thaw like this."</p>

<p>"Rabbits and ground squirrels and ptarmigan
can," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"Yeh&mdash;but yo' cain't!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going far. I'm wet now, and I'm
not going to give up without trying." Three
hours later he stumbled again through the door,
bearing proudly a bedraggled ptarmigan and a
lean ground squirrel, each neatly beheaded by a
bullet from his high-power rifle. As he dried his
clothing beside the rusty stove, the boy dressed
his game, carefully dividing the offal between old
Boris, Mutt, and Slasher, and the dogs greedily
devoured it to the last hair and feather.</p>

<p>"Every little bit helps," he smiled. "But it
sure is a little bit of meat for such a lot of work.
I bet I didn't get a quarter of a mile away."</p>

<p>For three days the wind held, the sun shone, and
the snow melted. Streams forced their way to
the river and the surface of the Kandik became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
raging torrent&mdash;a river on top of a river! Each
day Connie hunted faithfully, sometimes in vain,
but generally his efforts were rewarded by a
ptarmigan, or a brace of lank snowshoe rabbits
or ground squirrels, lured from their holes by
the feel of the false spring.</p>

<p>On the fourth night it turned cold, and in the
morning the snow was crusted over sufficiently
to support a man's weight on the rackets. The
countless tiny rills that supplied the river were
dried and the flood subsided and narrowed to
the middle of the stream, while upon the edges the
slush and anchor-ice froze rough and uneven.</p>

<p>Waseche Bill's injured leg was much swollen
and caused him great pain, but he bore it unflinchingly
and laughed and joked gaily. But
Connie was not deceived, for from the little
fan of wrinkles at the corners of the man's eyes,
and the hard, drawn look about his mouth, the boy
knew that his big partner suffered intensely even
while his lips smiled and his words fell lightly in
droll banter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanks to the untiring efforts of the boy, their
supply of provisions remained nearly intact, his
rifle supplying the meat for their frugal meals.
For two days past, O'Brien had brooded in silence,
sitting for hours at a time with his back against
the log wall and his gaze fixed, now upon the
wounded man, and again upon the boy, or the
great shaggy <i>malamutes</i> that lay sprawled upon
the floor. He did his full share of the work:
chopped the firewood, washed the dishes, and did
whatever else was necessary about the camp while
Connie hunted. But when he had finished he
lapsed into a gloomy reverie, during which he
would speak no word.</p>

<p>With the return of cold weather, the dogs had
been expelled from the cabin and had taken up
their quarters close beside the wall at the back.</p>

<p>"Me'be tomorrow we c'n hit the trail," said
Waseche, as he noticed that the sun of the fourth
day failed to soften the stiffening crust.</p>

<p>"We ought to make good time, now!" exclaimed
the boy. But Waseche shook his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, son, we won't make no good time the way
things is. The trail is rough an' the sha'p ice'll
cut the dawg's feet so they'll hate to pull. Likewise,
yo'n an' O'Brien's&mdash;them <i>mukluks</i> won't
last a day, an' the sleds'll be hahd to manage,
sluein' sideways an' runnin' onto the dawgs. I've
ice-trailed befo' now, an' it's wo'se even than soft
snow. If yo' c'n travel light so yo' c'n ride an'
save yo' feet an' keep the dawgs movin' fast, it
ain't so bad&mdash;but mushin' slow, like we got to,
an' sho't of grub besides&mdash;" The man shook
his head dubiously and relapsed into silence, while,
with his back against the wall, O'Brien listened
and hugged closer his cans of gold.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE DESERTER</p>


<p>Connie Morgan opened his eyes and blinked
sleepily. Then, instantly he became wide awake,
with a strange, indescribable feeling that all was
not well. Waseche Bill stirred uneasily in his
sleep and through the cracks about the edges of
the blanket-hung window and beneath the door
a dull grey light showed. The boy frowned as he
tossed back his robes and drew on his <i>mukluks</i>.
This was the day they were to hit the trail and
O'Brien should have had the fire going and called
him early. Suddenly the boy paused and stared
hard at the cold stove, and then at the floor
beside the stove&mdash;at the spot where O'Brien's
blankets and robes should have shown an untidy
heap in the dull light of morning. Lightning-like,
his glance flew to the place at the base of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
wall where the Irishman kept his gold&mdash;but the
blankets and robes were gone, and the gold was
gone, and O'Brien&mdash;? Swiftly the boy flew to
the door&mdash;the big sled was missing, the harness,
and McDougall's dogs were gone, and O'Brien
was nowhere to be seen!</p>

<p>For a long, long time the boy stood staring out
over the dim trail of the river and then with
clenched fists he stepped again into the room. A
hurried inspection of the pack showed that the
man had taken most of the remaining fish and
considerable of the food, also Waseche Bill's rifle
was missing from its place in the far corner. With
tight-pressed lips, Connie laid the fire in the little
stove and watched dumbly as the tiny yellow
sparks shot upward past the holes in the rusty
pipe. Vainly the mind of the boy strove to grasp
the situation, but his lips formed only the words
which he repeated over and over again, as if
seeking their import:</p>

<p>"He's gone&mdash;he's gone&mdash;O'Brien's gone." He
could not understand it. Among the dwellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in the great white land the boy had known only
men whose creed was to stick together until the
end. From the hour he first set foot upon the
dock at Anvik, to this very moment, with the single
exception of the little rat-faced man at Ten Bow,
the boy had learned to love the big men of the
North&mdash;men whose vices were rugged vices&mdash;flaunting
and unashamed and brutish, perhaps&mdash;but
men, any one of whom would face privation,
want, and toil&mdash;death itself&mdash;with a laugh in his
teeth for the privilege of helping a friend&mdash;and
who would fight to divide his last ounce of bacon
with his enemy. For not by rule of life&mdash;but life
itself men live upon the edges of the world, where
little likes and hates are forgotten, and all stand
shoulder to shoulder against their common enemy&mdash;the
North! These were the men the boy had
known. And now, for the first time, he was
confronted by another kind of man&mdash;a man so
yellow that, rather than face the perils and hardships
of the trail, he had deserted those who had
rescued him from a band of savages&mdash;and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
only deserted, but had taken with him the only
means by which the others could hope to reach
civilization, and had left a wounded man and a
little boy to die in the wilderness&mdash;bushed!</p>

<p>The dull soul-hurt of the boy flashed into
swift anger and, flinging open the door, he shook
a small fist toward the south.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/i-p299.jpg" width="660" height="263" alt="My dad followed British Kronk eight hundred miles through
the snow before he caught him&mdash;and then&mdash;you just wait." title="My dad followed British Kronk eight hundred miles through the snow before he caught him&mdash;and then&mdash;you just wait." />
<span class="caption">&quot;My dad followed British Kronk eight hundred miles through
the snow before he caught him&mdash;and then&mdash;you just wait.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"You cur!" he shouted. "You dirty cur!
You <i>piker</i>! You think you've fixed us&mdash;but you
wait! They say my dad followed British Kronk
eight hundred miles through the snow before he
caught him&mdash;and then&mdash;<i>you just wait!</i> You
tried to starve Waseche!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heah! Heah! What's all this?" asked the
man, who had raised himself to his elbow upon
the bunk. The boy faced him:</p>

<p>"He's beat it!" he choked. "He swiped Mac's
dogs and breezed!" for a moment the man
stared uncomprehendingly:</p>

<p>"Yo' mean O'Brien&mdash;he's <i>gone</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's gone! And so are the dogs, and the
sled, and your rifle, and his robes, and his gold!"</p>

<p>"How about the grub?" asked Waseche. "Did
he take that, too?"</p>

<p>"Only about a third of it&mdash;he's travelling light."
For a fleeting instant the boy caught the gleam
of Waseche's eyes, and then the gleam was gone
and the man's lips smiled.</p>

<p>"Sho', now," he drawled. "Sho', now." The
drawl was studied, and the voice was low and very
steady&mdash;too low and steady, thought the boy&mdash;and
shivered.</p>

<p>"Neveh yo' mind, son. We-all ah all right.
Jest yo' keep on a huntin' an' a fetchin' in rabbits
an' ptarmigan, an' such like, an' now the snow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
hahdened, me'be yo'll get a crack at a moose oah a
caribou. The heahd ort to pass somewhehs neah
heah soon. We'll jest lay up heah an' wait fo'
the break-up, an' then we'll build us a raft an'
go akitin' down to the Yukon&mdash;an' then&mdash;"
The voice suddenly hardened, and again the gleam
was in the grey eyes, but the man ceased speaking
abruptly.</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;what?" asked Connie, as he
studied his partner's face. The man laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;then we-all c'n go back to Ten
Bow&mdash;to <i>home</i>! But, come now, le's eat breakfast.
We-all got to go light on the grub. Come
on out of that, yo' li'l ol' <i>tillicum</i>, standin' theah
in the do' shakin' yo' fist! Puts me in mind of a
show I seen onct down to Skagway, in the opery
house: Julia See's Ah, I rec'lect was the name
of it, an' they was a lot of fist shakin' an' fancy
speeches by the men, which they was Greasers
oah Dagoes that woah sheets wropped around
'em, 'stead of pants an' shirts. They was one
fellow, See's Ah, his name was&mdash;it was him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
show was about. Neah as we-all c'd figgeh, he
was a mighty good soht of a pahty, a king oah
pres'dent, oah somethin', an' he had a friend,
name of Brutish, that he'd done a heap fo', an'
helped along, an' thought a heap of; an' anotheh
friend name of Mahk Antony. Well, seems like
this heah Brutish got soah at See's Ah, I didn't
rightly get what fo'&mdash;but it don't make no dif'ence&mdash;anyhow,
he got a fellow name of Cashus, an' a
couple mo' scoundrels an' they snuck up on See's
Ah when he worn't lookin' an' stabbed him in
the back. It sho' made us mad, an' we-all yelled
at See's Ah to look out, 'cause we seen 'em fingehin'
theah knives in undeh theah sheets&mdash;but he didn't
get what we was drivin' at, an' when he did look
it was too late. We waited a spell while the
show went on, to see what Mahk Antony, See's
Ah's otheh friend, w'd do to Brutish an' his gang&mdash;but
he jest hung around makin' fancy speeches
an' such-like until we-all got plumb disgusted."
Waseche Bill paused until Connie, who had been
listening eagerly, grew impatient.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what <i>did</i> he do?"</p>

<p>"Nawthin'," replied the man. "We done
it fo' him. Cou'se, it was only a show, an' they
didn't really kill See's Ah, but we-all didn't like
the idee, an' so when we seen Mahk didn't aim
to do nawthin' but orate, we-all let a yell out of
us an' run up the aisle an' clim' onto the stage an'
grabbed Brutish an' Cashus an' Mahk Antony, too,
an' run 'em down an' chucked 'em into the Lynn
Canal. It was winteh, an' the wateh was cold,
an' we soused 'em good an' propeh, an' when
they got out they snuck onto theah boat an' we-all
went back to the opery house an' got See's
Ah, an' tuck him oveh to the <i>ho</i>tel an' give him a
rousin' big suppeh an' told him how we was all fo'
him an' he c'd count on a squeah deal in Skagway
every time. An' Grub Stake John Billin's give
him a six-shooteh an' showed him how he c'd
hide it in undeh his sheet an' lay fo' 'em next time
they snuck up on him that-a-way. See's Ah
thanked us all an' we walked down to the boat
with him in case Brutish an' his gang aimed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
waylay him. An' then he made us a fine speech
an' went on up the gangway laughin' an' chucklin'
fit to kill at the way he'd suhprise them theah
assinatehs next time they ondehtook to stick
him in the back." Waseche Bill finished, and
after a long pause Connie asked:</p>

<p>"And O'Brien reminds you of Brutish?"</p>

<p>"Yes, son. An' I was jest a wondehin' what
the boys'll do to him down in Eagle when they see
Mac's dawgs, an' ask him how come he to have
'em, an' wheah yo' an' me is at. Yo' see, son,
Big Jim Sontag an' Joe an' Fiddle Face, an' a lot
mo' of the boys was down to Skagway that night."</p>

<p>In the little cabin on the Kandik the days
dragged slowly by. Waseche's leg mended slowly,
and despite the boy's most careful attention,
remained swollen and discoloured. Connie
hunted during every minute of daylight that could
be spared from his camp duties, but game was
scarce, and although the boy tramped miles and
miles each day, his bag was pitifully small. A
snowbird or a ptarmigan now and then fell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
his rifle and he found that it required the utmost
care to keep from blowing his game to atoms
with the high-power rifle. How he longed for a
shotgun or a twenty-two calibre rifle as he dragged
himself wearily over the hard crust of the snow.
The cold weather had driven the ground squirrels
into their holes and even the rabbits stuck close
to cover. The boy set snares made from an old
piece of fishline, but the night-prowling wolverines
robbed them, as the line was too rotten for jerk
snares.</p>

<p>The partners were reduced to one meal a day,
now, and that a very scanty one. Day after
day the boy circled into the woods, and day by
day the circle shortened. He was growing weak,
and was forced often to rest, and the buckle
tongue of his belt rested in a knife slit far
beyond the last hole.</p>

<p>Tears stood in Waseche Bill's eyes as each day
he noted that the little face was thinner and
whiter than upon the preceding day, and that the
little shoulders drooped lower as the boy returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
from his hunt and sat wearily down upon the floor
to pluck the feathers from a small snowbird.</p>

<p>On the morning of the tenth day, Connie
bravely shouldered his rifle and with a cheery
"Good-bye, pardner" carefully closed the door
behind him. Old Boris, Mutt, and Slasher had
managed to eke out a scant living by running
rabbits at night, but they were little more than
skin and bones, at best, and during the day lay
huddled together in the sunshine near the cabin.
As the boy passed out into the cold, clear air
he noticed that the dogs were gone from their
accustomed place.</p>

<p>"That's funny," he thought. "I wonder if
they pulled out, too?" And then, as if ashamed
of the thought, he jerked his shoulders erect.
"Not by a long shot! Those dogs will stick with
us till the end! They are no pikers! They're
<i>tillicums</i>!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, from far down the river, came a
clear, bell-like howl, followed by a chorus of frantic
yelps and savage growls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dogs!" cried the boy and, gripping his
rifle, made his way down the steep bank and out
upon the hard crust of the river. On and on he
ran, in the direction of the sounds that came
from beyond a sharp, wooded bend. The ice
was slippery but uneven, and studded with sharp
points of frozen snow that cut cruelly into his
feet through the holes of his worn <i>mukluks</i>. In
his weakened condition the effort was a serious
drain upon the boy's strength, but he kept on
running, stumbling, slipping&mdash;and in more places
than one his footsteps were marked by dark
patches of red. Around the wooded bend he tore
and there, upon the smooth ice of a backwater
pool, stood a huge bull moose, which, with lowered
antlers and bristling mane, fought off the savage
attacks of the three dogs. Again and again the
dogs charged the great animal, whose hoofs slipped
clumsily upon the ice with each movement of the
huge body. Round and round they circled,
seeking a chance to dash in past those broad
antlers, but with blazing eyes the moose faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
them, turning swiftly but awkwardly, as upon
an uncentred pivot, while the breath whistled
through his distended nostrils and spread into
frozen plumes. So intent was the great beast
upon the attack of the dogs that he gave no heed
to the small boy who gazed spellbound upon
this battle of the wilds. For a long time Connie
stood, entirely forgetful of the rifle that remained
firmly clutched in his hands, and as he watched, a
wave of admiration and sympathy swept over
him for this huge monarch of the barren lands
that, in his own fastnesses, stood at bay against
the gleaming white fangs of his tormentors. Then
into his brain leaped another thought&mdash;here was
meat! Half a ton of good red meat that meant
life to his starving partner, to himself, and to his
three beloved dogs. Slowly and deliberately
the boy dropped to his knee and raised his rifle.
The sights wavered to the trembling of his hands
and, summoning all the power that was in him,
he concentrated upon the steadying of his aim.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> The sound of the shot rang sharp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
clear through the cold air, and the moose, with a
loud snort, reared upward, whirled, and fell
crashing upon his side, while his powerful legs,
with their sharp hoofs, thrashed and clawed at
the ice. Instantly Slasher was at his throat, and
old Boris and Mutt rushed blindly in, snapping
and biting at the great, hairy body. Hastily
jamming a fresh cartridge into his barrel, Connie
sprang forward, and with muzzle held close,
placed a finishing shot low down behind the
point of the shoulder. But the strain upon his
poorly nourished body had been too great for the
boy to stand. The long run down the river and
the excitement of the kill had taxed his endurance
to the limit. A strange weakness seemed dragging
at his limbs, pulling him down, down, down into
some vast, intangible depth. Mechanically he
drew the knife from its sheath and dragged himself
to the body of the moose, and then, suddenly,
the world went dark, and he seemed to be whirling,
easily and slowly, into a place of profound silence.
And almost at the same moment, around another</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Mechanically he drew the knife from its sheath and dragged himself to the body of the moose.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>bend of the river, from the direction of the Yukon,
dashed a long, tawny dog team, and another, and
another, and with a wild yell of joy, O'Brien, red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
whiskers ablaze in the sunlight, leaped from the
foremost sled and gathered the unconscious form
of the boy into his arms; while beside him, all
talking at once and hampering each other's
movements in their frantic efforts to revive the
boy, were Fiddle Face, and Joe, and Big Jim
Sontag, and others of the men of Eagle.</p>

<p>Slowly Connie Morgan opened his eyes and
gazed, puzzled, into the bearded faces of the men
of the North. His glance rested upon the face
of O'Brien peering anxiously into his own, and
strayed to the dogs of the leading team&mdash;McDougall's
dogs&mdash;and to the sleds loaded with provisions,
and then, with the tears streaming from
his eyes, the boy struggled to his feet and a small
hand shot out and grasped the rough, hairy hand
of O'Brien&mdash;<i>the deserter who came back!</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class ="tdc">MISTER SQUIGG</p>


<p>It was a jovial gathering that crowded the
little cabin on the Kandik where the men of the
North feasted until far into the night, and told
tales, and listened to wondrous adventures in the
gold country. But most eagerly they listened
to Connie Morgan and Waseche Bill, with their
marvellous tales of the Lillimuit&mdash;- and Carlson's
cans of gold.</p>

<p>"We've a yarn worth the tellin' ourself!"
exclaimed the man called Joe&mdash;the man who tried
to dissuade Waseche Bill and prevent Connie
Morgan from venturing into the unknown. "Ye
sh'd o' seen 'em come! Flat on his belly a-top
the sled&mdash;an' the dogs runnin' low an' true! A
bunch of us was watchin' the trail f'r Black Jack
Demaree an' the Ragged Falls mail: 'Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
comes!' someone yells, an' way down the river
we seen a speck&mdash;a speck that grow'd until it
was a dog team an' a man. <i>Jeerushelam</i>, but he
was a-comin'! 'Twornt no time till he was clost
enough to see 'twornt Black Jack. A cold day,
it was&mdash;reg'lar bitin', nippin' cold&mdash;with the
wind, an' the sweep o' the river. An' here come
the team on the high lope, an' a-whippin' along
behind 'em, the lightest loaded outfit man ever seen
hauled&mdash;jest a man, an' a blanket, an' two tomater
cans. Flat, he laid&mdash;low to the sweep o' the wind,
one arm around the cans, an' the other a-holdin'
onto the sled f'r all he was worth. The man
was O'Brien, yonder; an' up the bank he shot,
fair burnin' the snow, whirled amongst us, an'
piled the outfit up ag'in' Big Jim's stockade.
The nex' we know'd was a yell from Fiddle Face,
here:</p>

<p>"'It's McDougall's dogs!' An' before the
Irishman c'd get onto his feet, Fiddle Face was
a-top him with a hand at his throat. 'Where's
the kid?' he howls in O'Brien's ear, 'Where's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Sam Morgan's boy?' Fiddle Face's voice ain't
no gentle murmur&mdash;when he yells. But the
rest of us didn't hear it&mdash;us that was ontanglin'
the dogs. F'r, in the mix-up, the cover had come
off one of them tomater cans, an' there on the snow
was nuggets o' <i>gold</i>&mdash;jest a-layin' there dull an' yaller,
in a heap on the top o' the snow." Joe paused,
held a sputtering sulphur match to the bowl
of his pipe, and, after a few deep puffs, continued:
"Ye know how the sight o' raw gold, that-a-way,
gets <i>to</i> ye&mdash;when ye've put in the best an' the
hardest years o' yer life a-grubbin' an' a-gougin'
f'r it? Ye know the feelin' that comes all to onct
about yer belt line, an' how yer head feels
sort o' light, an' yer face burns, an' ye want to
holler, an' laugh, an' cry all to onct? Well, that
was us, a-standin' there by the stockade&mdash;all
but Fiddle Face. Him an' O'Brien was a-wallerin'
grip-locked in the snow, an' Fiddle Face was a-hollerin'
over an' over ag'in: 'Where's that kid?
Where's that kid?' an' all the while a-chokin' of
O'Brien so's he couldn't answer. Presen'ly we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
noticed 'em an' drug 'em apart. An' right then
every man jack o' us forgot the gold. F'r, on a
sudden, we remembered that little kid&mdash;the gameness
of him&mdash;an' how he'd give us the slip an'
took off alone into a country we didn't none o' us
dast to go to&mdash;way long in the fore part o' the
winter. We jerked O'Brien to his feet an' hustled
him into the <i>ho</i>tel, an' by that time he'd got back
his wind, an' he was a-tellin', an' a-beggin' us
not to lose no time, but to pack a outfit an' hit f'r
a little cabin on the Kandik. 'He's there!' he
hollers. 'An' his pardner, too! They're starvin'.
I've got the gold to pay f'r the grub&mdash;take it!
Take it all! Only git back to 'em! I know'd
we all couldn't make it, travellin' heavy an' slow
with the outfit an' a crippled man to boot.'</p>

<p>"Big Jim Sontag goes out an' scoops up the gold
where it laid <i>forgot</i>&mdash;an' then he comes back into
the room an' walks straight over to where O'Brien
was a-standin': 'We'll go!' says Jim, <i>'an' you'll
go, too</i>! An', if there's a cabin, like you say, an'
they're there, why <i>you</i> can't spend no gold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Eagle!' Jim steps closter&mdash;so clost that his
nose stops within two inches of O'Brien's, an' his
eyes a-borin' clean through to the back of O'Brien's
head: 'But if they <i>ain't</i> there,' he says, low
an' quiet like, '<i>then you don't spend no gold in
Eagle, neither&mdash;see?</i>' An' then Jim turns to us:
'Who'll go 'long?' he hollers. 'That there boy
is Sam Morgan's boy&mdash;we all know'd Sam
Morgan!' We sure did&mdash;an' we like to tore Jim's
roof off a-signifyin'. Then, we slung our outfits together
an' hit the trail. An' now, boys," Joe rose
to his feet and crossed to the bunk where the Irishman
sat between Connie and Waseche Bill, "it's
up to us to signify onct more." And, for the
first time in his life, O'Brien, whose lot in the
world had always been an obscure and a lowly one,
came to know something of what it meant to
have earned the regard of <i>men</i>!</p>

<p>The journey down the Kandik was uneventful,
and four days later the reinforced outfit camped
at the junction of the lesser river with the mighty
Yukon. Late that night the men of the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sat about the camp fire and their talk was of rich
strikes, and stampedes, and the unsung deeds of
men.</p>

<p>Connie Morgan listened with bated breath to
tales of his father. Waseche Bill learned from the
lips of the men of Eagle of the boy's escape from
the hotel, and of his dash for the Lillimuit that
ended, so far as the men who followed were concerned,
at the foot of the snow-piled Tatonduk
divide. And the men of Eagle learned of the
Lillimuit, and the white Indians, and of the
death of Carlson, and lastly, of the Ignatook,
the steaming creek with its floor of gold.</p>

<p>"An' we-all ah goin' back theah, sometime,"
concluded Waseche. "Me an' the kid, heah, an'
O'Brien, if he'll go&mdash;" To their surprise, O'Brien
leaped to his feet:</p>

<p>"Ye c'n count me in!" he cried. "Foive days
agone no power on earth c'd av dhrug me back
into that land av th' cheerless cowld. But,
now, 'tis dif'runt, an' if th' sun shoines war-rum
enough f'r th' loikes av ye&mdash;an' th' b'y, here&mdash;phy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
ut shoines war-rum enough f'r Pathrick O'Brien&mdash;av
ut river shoines at all."</p>

<p>"That's what I call a man!" yelled Fiddle
Face, and subsided instantly, for Waseche Bill
was speaking.</p>

<p>"As I was goin' on to say: with us will be some
of the boys from Ten Bow&mdash;McDougall, an'
Dutch Henery, an' Dick Colton, an' Scotty
McCollough, an' Black Jack Demaree from
Ragged Falls, an'&mdash;well, how about it, boys?
The gold is theah, an' me an' the kid, we aim to
let ouh frien's in on this heah strike. We'll sho'
be proud to have yo'-all jine us." With a loud
cheer, the men accepted Waseche's invitation&mdash;they
had seen O'Brien's gold.</p>

<p>"Jes' keep it undeh yo' hats till the time comes,"
cautioned Waseche. "We-all will slip yo'-all the
wehd, an' we don't want no tinhawns, noah
<i>chechakos</i>, noah pikehs along, 'cause the Ignatook
stampede is goin' to be a stampede of <i>tillicums</i>!"</p>

<p>In the morning the partners, accompanied by
O'Brien, said good-bye to the men of Eagle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
headed down the great river for the mouth of
the Ten Bow. On the third day, only a short
distance above the place where the Ten Bow
trail swerved from the Yukon between two high
bluffs, they came upon the camp of an Indian.
The red man was travelling light. He had just
come out of the hills, and with him were Waseche
Bill's dogs&mdash;the <i>malamutes</i> whose sudden stampede
had led the lost wayfarers through the narrow pass
to the crest of the Kandik divide, and&mdash;Alaska!</p>

<p>"Wheah'd yo' get them dawgs?" asked Waseche,
pointing to the <i>malamutes</i>. The Indian waved
his arm in the direction of the hills, and Waseche
nodded:</p>

<p>"Them's <i>my</i> dawgs&mdash;<i>nika komooks</i>."</p>

<p>The Indian scowled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Dem Pete Mateese dog," he grunted surlily.</p>

<p>"Pete Mateese!" cried Connie. "Do you know
Pete Mateese? Who is he? Where is he? We
want to find him."</p>

<p>The Indian glowered sullenly.</p>

<p>"W'at y'u wan' Pete Mateese?" he asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"We want to find him. We've got good news
for him. He's rich&mdash;plenty gold." At the words
the Indian laughed&mdash;not a mirthful laugh, but a
sneering, sardonic laugh of unbelief.</p>

<p>"White man beeg liar&mdash;all. Pete Mateese, she
Injun&mdash;breed. White man no tell Injun 'bout
gol'. Me'be so white man steal Injun gol'."</p>

<p>With Irish impetuosity, O'Brien leaped forward.</p>

<p>"Take thot back, ye rid shpalpeen!" he cried,
shaking a huge fist under the Indian's nose. "Av
ye say wan more wor-rd ag'in' th' b'y, Oi'll choke
th' gizzard out av ye befoor ye say ut!"</p>

<p>Waseche Bill held up a restraining hand.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, O'Brien, don't le's nobody huht
anybody. Le's get the straight of this heah.
Primary an' fo'most, we-all want to find out if
Pete Mateese <i>pulled out</i> on Carlson, oah, did he
aim to go back." At the mention of Carlson's
name the Indian turned quickly toward Waseche.</p>

<p>"Y'u know Carlson?" he asked. Waseche
Bill nodded.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yeh, I did know him."</p>

<p>"Wher' Carlson?"</p>

<p>"Dead." As Waseche pronounced the word
the Indian shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Carlson good white man. All good white man
dead. Sam Morgan, she dead, too."</p>

<p>"Sam Morgan!" exclaimed Connie. "What do
you know of Sam Morgan?"</p>

<p>"Sam Morgan good to Injun. Me&mdash;mos' die,
once&mdash;fi', seex winter 'go, in de beeg snow. Sam
Morgan com' 'long. Hav' one small piece bacon&mdash;one
small lump suet&mdash;eighteen mile&mdash;Hesitation.
Me&mdash;I got no grub. Fi', seex day I ain' got no grub.
Seek lak leetle baby. Sam Morgan, she mak' me
eat&mdash;sam' lak heem. Den she peek me oop an' car'
me&mdash;all night&mdash;all day. Nex' night, me'be so we
no mak'. See de light in leetle cabin, an' den we
com' Hesitation. Bot' of us, we pret' near die.
An' Sam Morgan, she laugh." The old Indian
paused and regarded the boy curiously: "Y'u know
Sam Morgan?" he asked. The boy's eyes were
very bright, and he cleared his throat huskily.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sam Morgan was my father," he said, in a
low, unsteady tone. The Indian stalked to the
boy and, pausing directly before him, lifted the
small chin and gazed long and searchingly into
the upturned grey eyes.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," he grunted, "y'u Sam Morgan boy.
Me hear 'bout y'u in Ten Bow."</p>

<p>"Where is Pete Mateese?" persisted Connie.
The Indian no longer hesitated.</p>

<p>"Pete Mateese, she Ten Bow. Work hard
for de money to buy grub an' tak' back to Carlson&mdash;way
back, pas' de divide, in de lan' of Niju
Tah&mdash;de lan' of de bad man, dead. But, she
don' git no money. Meestaire Squeeg, she cheat
Pete Mateese."</p>

<p>"Who is Misteh Squigg?" asked Waseche Bill.</p>

<p>"Meestaire Squeeg she leetle man. Got de
nose lak de fox, an' de bad eye lak' de snake. All
tam he mak' Pete Mateese work ver' mooch. Tell
heem, he mak' plent' money. But she no giv'
heem no money&mdash;always Pete Mateese got it
comin'&mdash;she got to wait. Som' day Meestaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Squeeg she pull out&mdash;den Pete Mateese got
nut'in."</p>

<p>"Yo' say he's a li'l slit-eyed runt&mdash;rat-faced&mdash;with
a squeaky voice?" Waseche mimicked
Mr. Squigg's tone. The Indian nodded emphatically,
and for a long time Waseche was silent&mdash;thinking.</p>

<p>"An' yo' say these heah is Pete Mateese's
dawgs?" Again the Indian nodded, and Waseche
Bill's eyes narrowed: "An' yo' say they ah in
Ten Bow&mdash;Pete Mateese an' this heah Misteh
Squigg?"</p>

<p>"Ten Bow," repeated the Indian. "Meestaire
Squeeg, she tak' de gol' an' buy de claim."
Waseche Bill turned to the others:</p>

<p>"Come on, we'll hit the trail!" And then, to
the Indian, "Yo' come, too, an' fetch them dawgs."
Connie noticed that his big partner's voice was
very low, and once, turning quickly, he surprised
the cold, hard gleam in the grey eyes.</p>

<p>"He must be the same man that tried to
make me give up my claim, the time I beat out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the Ten Bow stampede," confided the boy, as
he mushed beside Waseche's sled.</p>

<p>"Oh, he did&mdash;did he?" asked the man, in the
same low, hard tone. "We'll jest count that in,
too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Do you know Mr.
Squigg?"</p>

<p>"No. But I <i>will</i>," drawled Waseche. "Yo'
see, kid, he's the man I bought them dawgs off
of last fall in Eagle. Come along, now, le's mush.
I'm gettin' plumb anxious to meet up with this
heah Misteh Squigg."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class ="tdc">THE MAN WHO DIDN'T FIT</p>


<p>The return of Connie Morgan and Waseche Bill
to Ten Bow, and the events that followed, are
told to this day on the trails.</p>

<p>McDougall paused for a chat with Dutch
Henry beside the long black dump of the German's
claim.</p>

<p>"It's most time for the break-up, Mac," said
the owner of the dump. "We'll sluice out big, this
spring."</p>

<p>"Yes, mon, we will," agreed McDougall, as
his eyes roved to the small snow-covered dump
across the creek. "But, it's sore I've hated to
see yon claim idle the winter&mdash;an' the laddie
gaen&mdash;an' Waseche Bill&mdash;heaven knaws wheer.
D'ye mind what the mon fr' Eagle told, how the
lad c'd na be stopped, but trailed on after Waseche*<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
*&mdash;on to the Lillimuit? They'll na com' back."
Dutch Henry nodded.</p>

<p>"Sure, Mac, but whad' ye 'spect from the breed
of Sam Morgan? 'Member how he beat us all to
these here diggin's, with ondly them three old dogs.
I'd give my claim to have 'em safe back. An'
I'm sorry you lost your ten-team, too, Mac."</p>

<p>"Losh! Mon! 'Tis na'thing at a'&mdash;the dogs!
The laddie tuk 'em&mdash;an' welcome. Ye sh'd o'
seed the luk i' his e'e, the mornin' he com' bustin'
into my cabin wi' the news that Waseche was
gaen! 'I'll fetch him back,' he says, 'if I have to
beat him up'&mdash;an' him na bigger'n a pint o' cider.
They've gaen to the Lillimuit, Dutch, an' 'taint in
reason they'll com' back. But, sometimes, when
I think o' the luk i' the laddie's e'e, d'ye knaw, it
comes to me that, me'be&mdash;" The man's voice
trailed into silence as his gaze became fixed upon
the moving black specks that appeared far down
the Yukon trail. Dutch Henry's gaze followed the
big Scotchman's.</p>

<p>"Look, Mac! Look!" he cried excitedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
"Them dogs!" And, almost at the same instant,
with a roar like the bellow of a bull, McDougall
sprang down the trail between the straggling
cabins of Ten Bow, with Dutch Henry pounding
along in his wake. Before the two had covered
half the length of the camp other men joined them,
running and yelling&mdash;though they knew not why
they ran. Cabins and shafts were deserted and
all Ten Bow strung out on the trail to meet the
rapidly approaching dog teams. And when they
did meet, a half-mile beyond the camp, Connie
was rushed from his feet by the wildly yelling
crowd and carried triumphantly into Ten Bow
upon the broad shoulders of the big men of the
North. For, as McDougall had said, word had
come down from Eagle, and now, not because he
was Sam Morgan's boy, but for his own grit and
pluck and courage, Connie Morgan had won his
place among the sourdoughs of the silent land.</p>

<p>"Know a man name of Misteh Squigg?" asked
Waseche Bill of McDougall, as half a dozen men
sat late that night about the stove in the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
cabin that had lain deserted all through the
winter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I ken the mon&mdash;an' na gude o' him,
neither, wi' his leetle shifty e'en. I've mistrusted
um fr' the time I furst seed um. D'ye ken, laddie,
t'was him tried to drive ye fr' yer claim wi' his
lawyer's drivvle, whilst Waseche was down to
Hesitation?" Connie nodded, and McDougall
continued: "I sent him about his business i'
jig time, an' na more was he seed i' Ten Bow till a
matter o' three or four months agane up he pops
wi' a half-breed that's workin' f'r um. He bought
Dave Crampton's claim an' has be'n workin' ut
since. Why d'ye ask?" For answer Waseche
motioned to the Indian who sat upon his blanket
spread upon the floor:</p>

<p>"Kobuk, go fetch Pete Mateese. An' don't
let Misteh Squigg know yo' fetchin' him." The
Indian arose and passed noiselessly out into the
night. A quarter of an hour later he returned,
closely followed by a huge half-breed with mild,
ox-like eyes, who smiled broadly upon the assembly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heem Pete Mateese," grunted the Indian,
and sank again to his blanket. Waseche Bill
regarded the big, simple-minded half-breed intently,
and then flashed the question:</p>

<p>"Wheah is Carlson?" Instantly the smile
faded from the man's face and a look of deep
sorrow darkened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Lillimuit," he answered, sadly. "On Ignatook
he dig for de gol'." The half-breed looked about
him upon the faces of the men who wondered
what it was all about.</p>

<p>"Go on," encouraged Waseche, "tell more."</p>

<p>"De Ignatook, she don' freeze&mdash;she wa'm.
De white Injun, she don' go dare&mdash;she 'fraid. We
go dare, me an' Carlson, she ma pardner, an' she
say de gol' ees here. Bimby, de grub git low an'

<p>The big men and the one small boy in the
little cabin listened intently to the half-breed's
simply told tale. When he finished Waseche Bill
cleared his throat and glanced from one to the
other of the silent listeners.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys," he said, "Carlson is dead. He died
alone&mdash;way out yondeh in the Lillimuit. He died
huntin' fo' Pete Mateese, his pahdneh that didn't
come back. Befo' he died he found the gold he
know'd was theah. We seen the gold, an' it's
<i>cached</i> theah yet, jest wheah he done left it.
Carlson was a <i>man</i>. If Pete Mateese had went
back, he'd of be'n livin' now. An' Pete Mateese
would of went back if he'd of be'n let alone."
He ceased speaking and, without a word, Big
McDougall and Dick Colton rose from their
chairs and passed out into the night. The little
clock ticked monotonously while the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
waited. Presently the two returned, and between
them walked a little, rat-faced man. The man
was Mr. Squigg, and as he entered, his slit-like
eyes blinked rapidly in the lamp-light, and shot
nervous, venomous glances upon the faces of
the occupants of the cabin. At sight of Pete
Mateese his face flushed, then paled, and his thin
lips curled backward from his teeth.</p>

<p>"What you doin' here?" he rasped.</p>

<p>"He was sent fo', Misteh Squigg, same as yo'
was," drawled Waseche Bill.</p>

<p>"This is an outrage!" squeaked the man.
"Who are you? And what right have you got to
bring folks here against their will?"</p>

<p>"Who, me? Oh, I'm Waseche Bill. I jest
wanted fo' to meet up with yo'&mdash;that's all. Yo'
name fits yo' like a new glove, don't it, Misteh
Squigg? An', Misteh Squigg, this heah's my
pahdneh, Connie Mo'gan. I jest heahd how yo'
tried fo' to beat him out of this heah claim, back
when he beat out the stampede."</p>

<p>"He's a minor, an' he can't hold no claim,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
whimpered the man; "I'm a lawyer, an' I know.
But that was a long while ago. I'll let that pass."</p>

<p>"Sho' now, Misteh Squigg," Waseche drawled,
"it's good of yo' to let that pass. We was feared
yo' mout of laid it up against yo'self. But
theah's anotheh li'l matteh we-all would like to
cleah up befo' the evenin's oveh. Yo' rec'lect
I'm the pahty that bought them dawgs off yo'
in Eagle&mdash;but we'll come to that lateh. This heah
Pete Mateese, now, the's sev'el li'l items we-all
want the straight of. Fust off, wheah's the can
of gold Pete Mateese give yo' to buy grub with
in Eagle?"</p>

<p>"It's none of your business!" shrilled the man.
"Besides, it's a lie! I didn't see no gold. Let me
out of here! You ain't got no right to hold me."</p>

<p>"Ain't we? Well, Misteh Squigg, yo' might's
well know yo' ah undeh arrest, an' we-all aim to
give yo' a faih an' speedy trial."</p>

<p>"You <i>can't</i> arrest me!" squealed the man.</p>

<p>"But, we <i>done</i> it&mdash;didn't we? If yo' don't
b'lieve it, jest yo' try to walk out that do'."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ain't got no authority! It ain't accordin'
to law!"</p>

<p>"This heah ain't exactly a co'te of law&mdash;it's a
co'te of justice. They's quite a con'sid'ble
dif'ence&mdash;mostly," answered Waseche, and turning
to Connie, he said.</p>

<p>"Jest get out yo' pen, kid, an' set down the
figgehs so we c'n get things faih an' squah. One
can of gold, nine thousand dollahs. Now, them
dawgs&mdash;they was eight dawgs at fifty dollahs a
head, that's fo' hund'ed dollahs mo'."</p>

<p>"I object!" piped Mr. Squigg, "I'm a lawyer,
an' I know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yo' mout be a lawyeh, Misteh Squigg,
but yo' ain't in no shape to 'bject&mdash;not none
serious. Now, them wages owin' to Pete Mateese,
neah's we c'n calc'late, it's fo'teen months
at five dollahs a day. Figgeh it up, kid, an'
set it down." Connie busied himself over his
paper.</p>

<p>"That comes to twenty-one hundred dollars,"
he announced.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"It ain't true! I didn't agree to pay him!
You can't prove it! I deny everything!"</p>

<p>"Yo' ain't b'lieved," calmly drawled Waseche.
"How much yo got down altogetheh, son?"</p>

<p>"Eleven thousand five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Now, theah's this heah int'rest. Ten peh
cent, wornt it, Misteh Squigg?" But Mr. Squigg
only growled.</p>

<p>"Twelve thousand six hundred and fifty, all
told," computed Connie. Waseche turned to
the infuriated Mr. Squigg.</p>

<p>"That's what's owin' to Pete Mateese. C'n
yo' pay it&mdash;<i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't! An' I never will! Yo' can't
enforce no such high-handed proceedin's! It
ain't accordin' to law!"</p>

<p>"It's accordin' to Ten Bow, though," answered
Waseche, shortly. "An' seein' yo ain' got the
cash oah the dust, we-all'll jest trouble yo' to make
oveh yo' claim to Pete Mateese. An' bein' yo'
only give ten thousan' fo' it, yo' c'n give yo' note
fo' the balance. Give him the pen, son."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't do it! This is an outrage!" whined
the man.</p>

<p>"Sho', now, Misteh Squigg, co'se yo'll do it."
Waseche Bill turned to the others. "We-all will
give Misteh Squigg five minutes to think it oveh.
Then some of yo' boys jest amble out an' tell it
around camp&mdash;the story of Carlson, the man that
died 'cause his pahdneh couldn't go back. The
boys'll be right int'rested, 'cause a lot of 'em
know'd Carlson, an' they liked him. Mos' likely
they'll call a meetin' an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gi' me the pen! Gi' me the pen!" shrieked
Mr. Squigg, whose face had gone pasty white.
And the men saw that the hand that held the pen
trembled violently.</p>

<p>"Now, Misteh Squigg," announced Waseche,
when the other had finished, "<i>yo' git</i>! An' if yo'
know what's good fo' yo', yo'll keep on <i>gittin'</i>!
Alaska don't need such men as yo'. <i>Yo' don't
fit!</i> This heah's a <i>big</i> country, Misteh Squigg.
It's broad, an' long, an' clean. An' the men that
live in it ah rough men, but theah heahts is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
big as the country. An' they ah men that stand
fo'-squah with each otheh, an' with the wo'ld.
In Alaska a man c'n count on faih play, an' it
don't make no dif'ence if his hide is white, oah red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
oah yallah, oah black. 'Cause he ain't measu'ed
acco'din' to colah noah heft, noah by the gold in
his poke, neitheh. It's what a man <i>does</i> that
counts. The li'l eveh-day acts an' deeds that
shows wheah his heaht is&mdash;an' what's in him.
An', now, Misteh Squigg, yondeh's the do'.
An' beyond, the trail stretches away&mdash;an' fah
away. Eveh mile yo' put between yo'self an
Ten Bow is a friend of yo'n. Me'be somewheahs
theah's a place li'l enough fo' a man with a heaht
as small, an' hahd, an' black as a double B shot.
If they is, an' yo' c'n find it, yo'll be <i>home</i>. But
don't stop to hunt fo' it in Alaska&mdash;it ain't heah."
As Waseche Bill finished, the door opened and,
without a word, Mr. Squigg slunk into the
star-lit night&mdash;the softly radiant night that
brushed caressingly the white snows of Aurora
Land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 646px;">
<img src="images/i-p337.jpg" width="646" height="660" alt="Squigg slunk into the star-lit night." title="Squigg slunk into the star-lit night." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Squigg slunk into the star-lit night.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class="p4" />

<p>Late the men of Ten Bow talked about the little
stove. At last, when they arose to go, Big McDougall
stepped close to Connie's side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Laddie," he said, "wad ye do a favour f'r
an auld mon&mdash;jest the ain time?"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the boy, and his eyes shone,
"do a favour for <i>you</i>! For the man that lent
me the best dog-team in all Alaska! Why, if it
hadn't been for your dogs, Mac, I could never
have found Waseche. Just name it, and you'll
see!"</p>

<p>"Weel spoken, lad! Spoken like a mon!"
The Scot's eyes twinkled. "An' I'll hold ye to
yer word. The favour is this: that ye'll accept
the ten-team o' <i>malamutes</i> that's carried ye so far
acrost unmapped miles, as a present fr' an auld
mon whose heart thinks more o' ye than his rough
auld tongue c'n tell." The boy stared speechless
at the big, smiling man. And when, at length,
he found his voice, the words choked in his throat:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you said&mdash;it was a favour, Mac&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wheest, laddie, an' a favour it is. For McDougall's
growin' auld f'r the trails. Theer's
gude years ahead o' yon dogs, but I've na mind
to gi' 'em the wark they need to keep 'em in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
fettle. An' dogs is oncommon like men&mdash;'gin
they loaf aboot the streets o' town a spell they get
lazy an' no 'count. But, wi' yersel' to put 'em
ower the trail noo an' again, they'll be a team
o' pleasure an' profit to ye. F'r they're braw
dogs altogether an' t'would be shamefu' they
should dwindle to the common herd o' scavage
dogs."</p>

<p>And so, Connie, gracefully as he could in his
confusion, granted McDougall's favour. But
in doing so the small boy could not foresee&mdash;nor
could any man in the cabin foresee&mdash;the chain of
adventures into which the possession of the ten-team
would lead him. For, had he not owned
the ten-team, he would not have happened, just
at the right moment, upon Big Dan McKeever, sergeant
of the Royal North-West Mounted Police,
at a time when the sergeant, with white, set face,
battled against odds of a thousand to one, while
fifty men looked helplessly out across the mile-wide
field of heaving, crashing river ice when the
spring break-up hit the mighty Yukon. And, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Sergeant McKeever&mdash;but all that has no part
in this story.</p>

<p>In the little cabin on Ten Bow the hour was
late, and the bearded men had arisen to go. As
each passed through the door to seek his own cabin,
he gripped hard the hand of Pete Mateese, and
O'Brien, and Waseche Bill&mdash;and <i>both</i> hands of
Connie Morgan&mdash;the boy who was a <i>tillicum</i>.</p>

<p>As they wended their way homeward in the
midnight the little stars winked and glittered
radiantly upon these big men of the North.
While far away on the long bleak trail, the same
little stars gleamed cold and hard upon a swiftly
moving black speck where, with white face and
terror-gripped heart, Mr. Squigg added friendly
miles to the distance that separated Ten Bow
from <i>The Man Who Didn't Fit</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>
